.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on\.
.
.P
A \fBpackage\fR is:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
a) a folder containing a program described by a package\.json file
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
b) a gzipped tarball containing (a)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
c) a url that resolves to (b)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
d) a \fB<name>@<version>\fR that is published on the registry with (c)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
e) a \fB<name>@<tag>\fR that points to (d)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
f) a \fB<name>\fR that has a "latest" tag satisfying (e)
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Even if you never publish your package, you can still get a lot of
benefits of using npm if you just want to write a node program (a), and
perhaps if you also want to be able to easily install it elsewhere
after packing it up into a tarball (b)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
npm install (in package directory, no arguments):
Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder\.
.
.IP
In global mode (ie, with \fB\-g\fR or \fB\-\-global\fR appended to the command),
it installs the current package context (ie, the current working
directory) as a global package\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
npm install \fB<folder>\fR:
Install a package that is sitting in a folder on the filesystem\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
npm install \fB<tarball file>\fR:
Install a package that is sitting on the filesystem\.  Note: if you just want
to link a dev directory into your npm root, you can do this more easily by
using \fBnpm link\fR\|\.
.
.IP
In order to distinguish between this and remote installs, the argument
must either be "\." or contain a "/" in it\.
.
.IP
Example:
.
.IP
  npm install \./package\.tgz
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
npm install \fB<tarball url>\fR:
Fetch the tarball url, and then install it\.  In order to distinguish between
this and other options, the argument must start with "http://" or "https://"
.
.IP
Example:
.
.IP
  npm install http://github\.com/waveto/node\-crypto/tarball/v0\.0\.5
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
npm install \fB<name>\fR:
Do a \fB<name>@<tag>\fR install, where \fB<tag>\fR is the "tag" config\. (See \fBnpm help config\fR)
.
.IP
Example:
.
.IP
  npm install sax
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
npm install \fB<name>@<tag>\fR:
Install the version of the package that is referenced by the specified tag\.
If the tag does not exist in the registry data for that package, then this
will fail\.
.
.IP
Example:
.
.IP
  npm install sax@stable
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
npm install \fB<name>@<version>\fR:
Install the specified version of the package\.  This will fail if the version
has not been published to the registry\.
.
.IP
Example:
.
.IP
  npm install sax@0\.1\.1
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
npm install \fB<name>@<version range>\fR:
Install a version of the package matching the specified version range\.  This
will follow the same rules for resolving dependencies described in \fBnpm help json\fR\|\.
.
.IP
Note that most version ranges must be put in quotes so that your shell will
treat it as a single argument\.
.
.IP
Example:
.
.IP
  npm install sax@">=0\.1\.0 <0\.2\.0"
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
You may combine multiple arguments, and even multiple types of arguments\.
For example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
npm install sax@">=0\.1\.0 <0\.2\.0" bench supervisor
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The \fB\-\-tag\fR argument will apply to all of the specified install targets\.
.
.P
The \fB\-\-force\fR argument will force npm to fetch remote resources even if a
local copy exists on disk\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
npm install sax \-\-force
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The \fB\-\-global\fR argument will cause npm to install the package globally
rather than locally\.  See \fBnpm help global\fR\|\.
.
.P
The \fB\-\-link\fR argument will cause npm to link global installs into the
local space in some cases\.
.
.P
See \fBnpm help config\fR\|\.  Many of the configuration params have some
effect on installation, since that\'s most of what npm does\.
