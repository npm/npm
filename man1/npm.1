.SH "NAME"
\fBnpm\fR \-\- node package manager
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.
.nf
npm <command> [args]
.
.fi
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
npm is a package manager for the Node javascript library\.
.
.P
Run \fBnpm help\fR to get a list of commands\.
.
.SH "STATUS: Useful Beta"
The core functionality is there\.  It works\.
.
.P
Please use this software\.  It will cut you occasionally\.  Let me know when
you find a rough edge, and I\'ll sand it down for you\.
.
.P
I appreciate your sense of adventure\.
.
.SH "INTRO"
You probably got npm because you want to install stuff\.
.
.P
Use \fBnpm install blerg\fR to install the latest version of "blerg"\.  Check out \fBnpm help install\fR for more info\.  It can do a lot of stuff\.
.
.P
Use the \fBnpm ls\fR command to show everything that\'s available\.  Looking for
express\-related modules?  \fBnpm ls express\fR\|\.  Looking for the latest express? \fBnpm ls express latest\fR\|\.  (The arguments are just simple greps\.)  And of course, \fBnpm help ls\fR will tell you more\.
.
.P
Use \fBnpm ls installed\fR to show everything you\'ve installed\.
.
.SH "CONFIGS"
Use the \fBnpm config\fR command to manage how npm does stuff and where it puts things\.
It stores your configs in the \fB~/\.npmrc\fR file\.  Check \fBnpm help config\fR for more
info on that, if you care\.
.
.P
You can override any config for just a single command by doing \fB\-\-configname value\fR
on the command line\.
.
.SH "DEVELOPERS"
If you\'re using npm to develop and publish your code, check out the following topics:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
json:
Make a package\.json file\.  The "json" help doc will tell you what to put in it\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
link:
For linking your current working code into Node\'s path, so that you don\'t have to
reinstall every time you make a change\.  Use "npm link" to do this\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
install:
It\'s a good idea to install things if you don\'t need the symbolic link\.  Especially,
installing other peoples code from the registry is done via "npm install"\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
adduser:
Use the \fBnpm adduser\fR command to add a user account for the npm registry, or to
authorize yourself on a new machine\.  If you forget your password, send an email
to \fInpm\-@googlegroups\.com\fR and we\'ll delete your account so you can recreate it\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
publish:
Use the \fBnpm publish\fR command to upload your code to the registry, so that other
people can install it easily\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "CONTRIBUTIONS"
Patches welcome!
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
code:
Read through \fBnpm help coding\-style\fR if you plan to submit code\.  You don\'t have to
agree with it, but you do have to follow it\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
docs:
If you find an error in the documentation, edit the appropriate markdown file in the
"doc" folder\.  (Don\'t worry about generating the man page\.)
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Contributors are listed in npm\'s \fBpackage\.json\fR file\.
.
.SH "PRINCIPLES"
Put the files where they need to be so that node can find them using the
methods it already uses\.
.
.P
Be lazy, not clever\.
.
.P
The file system is the database\.
.
.P
Sync with habits that are already in use\.
.
.P
Packages should be maintained by their authors, not by the package manager
author\.
.
.P
Steer clear of dependency hell\.
.
.SH "BUGS"
Plenty\.  Luckily, npm is actively maintained as of this writing\.
.
.P
When you find issues, please report them:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
web: \fIhttp://github\.com/isaacs/npm/issues\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
email: \fInpm\-@googlegroups\.com\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Be sure to include \fIall\fR of the output from the npm command that didn\'t work
as expected\.
.
.P
You can also look for isaacs in #node\.js on irc://irc\.freenode\.net\.
