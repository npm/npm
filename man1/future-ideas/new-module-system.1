.SH "NAME"
\fBnpm-folders\fR \-\- Folder Structures Used by npm
.
.SH "FUTURE"
This functionality is not yet implemented\.  It is a plan, not reality\.
It is not the map, nor the territory, but a blueprint with blank areas\.
.
.P
In particular, this is the scheme that will be used starting in npm@0\.3,
which will require node@0\.5\.0 or above\.
.
.SH "GOALS"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Don\'t splat stuff across the filesystem so much\.  Just specify a single
root location, and be done with it\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Work on windows\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Minimize shim/symlink usage\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Do not rely on any global system path for node modules\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Remove the "activation" concept\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
npm metadata lives in the \fBroot\fR setting\.  There is the cache folder,
and the contents of all installed packages\.
.
.P
The default npm root folder is \fB/usr/local/lib/npm\fR\|\.
.
.P
TODO: What should the root folder be on windows?
.
.SS "Cache folder"
The cache folder is a mirror of the data in the registry, as well as a
working space for unpacking and creating tarballs\.
.
.P
Files and folders created in the cache are owned by the executing user,
often "root"\.
.
.P
Files are created with 0666 and folders with 0777, so that they can be
modified by any user\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBroot/cache\fR Cache folder
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBroot/cache/foo/cache\.json\fR Expirable cache of registry/foo json data
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBroot/cache/foo/1\.2\.3/package\fR Pristine copy of foo package contents
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBroot/cache/foo/1\.2\.3/package\.tgz\fR tarball of foo@1\.2\.3
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "Package folders"
In the npm root folder, package contents are unpacked, built, and then
moved into the desired location\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBroot/packages/foo/1\.2\.3\fR Metadata and contents of foo@1\.2\.3
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBroot/packages/foo/1\.2\.3/package\fR Build location of foo@1\.2\.3
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBroot/packages/foo/1\.2\.3/node_modules\fR Links to (or, on windows, copies of)
dependencies of foo@1\.2\.3
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBroot/packages/foo/1\.2\.3/metadata\.json\fR Metadata about the foo package\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "Installation in `node_modules` Folders"
When you run \fBnpm install foo@1\.2\.3\fR it downloads and builds the
package, and then, if there is a package\.json file in the current
working directory, it copies it to \fB$PWD/node_modules/foo\fR, so that your
current package will get it when you do \fBrequire("foo")\fR\|\.
.
.P
When this is done, it also installs all of foo\'s dependencies to \fB\|\./node_modules/foo/node_modules/\fR, so that it will get its dependencies
appropriately when it calls \fBrequire()\fR\|\.  If foo depends on bar, and bar
depends on baz, then there will also be a \fB\|\./node_modules/foo/node_modules/bar/node_modules/baz\fR, and so on\.
.
.P
If there is not a package\.json in the current working directory, then
npm walks up the working dir parent paths looking for a package\.json,
indicating the root of a package, or a node_modules folder,
indicating an npm package deployment location, and then take the party to that
location\.  This behavior may be suppressed by setting the \fBseek\-root\fR
config value to false\.
.
.P
If no package root is found, then a global installation is performed\.
The global installation may be supressed by setting the \fBglobal\fR
configuration to false, in which case, the install will fail\.
.
.SS "Global Installation"
If the \fBglobal\fR configuration is set to true, or if it is not explicitly
set false and no suitable node_modules folder was found, then npm will
install packages "globally"\.
.
.P
This means that the module contents are symlinked (or, on windows,
copied) from \fBroot/<name>/<version>/package\fR to \fBroot/node_modules/<name>\fR\|\.
.
.SS "Installing executables"
When installing globally, executables are linked (or, on windows,
shimmed with a \.bat file) to \fBroot/bin\fR\|\.
.
.P
When doing a
localized installation, executables are linked (or, on windows, shimmed)
to \fB\|\./node_modules/\.bin\fR\|\.  This also applies to the case when a globally
installed package\'s dependents are being installed into it\.  Basically,
whenever writing \fB\|\.\.\./node_modules/foo\fR, and the "foo"
package has an executable named "bar", it\'ll write it to \fB\|\.\.\./node_modules/\.bin/bar\fR\|\.
.
.P
It is up to the user to update their PATH environment variable
appropriately for globally installed executables\.  When running package
lifecycle scripts (for example, to build, start, test, etc\.), npm will
put \fB\|\./node_modules/\.bin\fR as the first item in the PATH environ\.
.
.SS "Installing manpages"
npm will install man pages to \fBroot/share/man\fR\|\.  It is up to the user to
make sure that their man program searches this location\.
.
.SS "Cycles, Conflicts, and Folder Parsimony"
Cycles are handled using the property of node\'s module system that it
walks up the directories looking for node\fImodules folders\.  So, at every
stage, if a package is already installed in an ancestor node\fRmodules
folder, then it is not installed at the current location\.
.
.P
Consider the case above, where \fBfoo \-> bar \-> baz\fR\|\.  Imagine if, in
addition to that, baz depended on bar, so you\'d have: \fBfoo \-> bar \-> baz \-> bar \-> baz \.\.\.\fR\|\.  However, since the folder
structure is: foo/node\fImodules/bar/node\fRmodules/baz, there\'s no need to
put another copy of bar into \.\.\./baz/node\fImodules, since when it calls
require("bar"), it will get the copy that is installed in
foo/node\fRmodules/bar\.
.
.P
This shortcut is only used if the exact same
version would be installed in multiple nested node_modules folders\.  It
is still possible to have \fBa/node_modules/b/node_modules/a\fR if the two
"a" packages are different versions\.  However, without repeating the
exact same package multiple times, an infinite regress will always be
prevented\.
.
.P
Another optimization can be made by installing dependencies at the
highest level possible, below the localized "target" folder\.
.
.P
For example, consider this dependency graph:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
foo
+\-\- bar@1\.2\.3
|   +\-\- baz@2\.x
|   |   `\-\- quux@3\.x
|   `\-\- asdf@*
`\-\- baz@1\.2\.3
    `\-\- quux@3\.x
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
In this case, we\'d expect a folder structure like this:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
foo
+\-\- node_modules
    +\-\- bar (1\.2\.3)
    |   `\-\- node_modules
    |       `\-\- baz (2\.0\.2)
    +\-\- quux (3\.2\.0)
    +\-\- asdf (0\.2\.5)
    `\-\- baz (1\.2\.3)
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Since foo depends directly on bar@1\.2\.3 and baz@1\.2\.3, those are
installed in foo\'s node_modules folder\.
.
.P
Since baz@1\.2\.3 depends on quux@3\.x, a satisfying version is placed in
foo\'s node_modules folder, because there are no conflicts\.
.
.P
Since bar@1\.2\.3 depends on asdf@*, a satisfying version is placed in
foo\'s node\fImodules folder\.  It also depends on baz@2\.x, but this
conflicts with the version already installed in foo\'s node\fRmodules
folder, so it is installed into the node_modules folder under bar@1\.2\.3\.
.
.P
baz@2\.0\.2 depends on quux@3\.x, but this dependency is already satisfied
by the quux version installed in foo\'s node_modules folder, so nothing
further needs to be done\.
.
.SS "Snapshotting"
Whenever the \fBnpm snapshot\fR command is run, the package\.json file is
updated to include the versions of all of the packages in the \fB\|\./node_modules\fR folder as dependencies\.
.
.SS "Publishing"
Upon publishing, npm will look in the node_modules folder\.  If any of
the items there are on the "dependencies" or "devDependencies" list, and
are unmodified copies of the corresponding packages in \fBroot/node_modules/<name>/<version>/package\fR, then they will not be
included in the package tarball\.
.
.P
If the package has been modified, then it is left as\-is, and included in
the package\.
.
.P
This allows a package maintainer to install all of their dependencies
(and dev dependencies) locally, but only publish those items that cannot
be found elsewhere\.
.
.SS "Updating"
npm keeps track of every installation of foo@1\.2\.3 in \fBroot/packages/foo/1\.2\.3/metadata\.json\fR\|\.
.
.P
When updating in a package folder (see algorithm for determining this in
"Installation in \fBnode_modules\fR Folders"), npm updates the packages in
the local folder to the latest versions that are compatible with the
requirements in the package\.json file\.
.
.P
If global is set to \fB"super"\fR, then npm will attempt to update
all copies of packages installed anywhere and everywhere that it is
aware of\.
.
.P
If \fBglobal\fR is set to `true, or implied by not being in a package folder
at the time, then npm will update the globally installed packages\.
.
.P
If you do \fBnpm update foo\fR, and you\'re in a local package folder, but \fBfoo\fR is not installed there, and it \fIis\fR installed globally, then that
will be equivalent to doing \fBnpm update foo \-\-global\fR\|\.
.
.SS "Uninstalling"
Uninstalling works like updating\.
.
.P
If global is set to "super", then it removes all traces from everywhere\.
.
.P
If global is set to "true", or implied, then it removes the global copy\.
.
.P
If global is set to "false", or unset and the command is in a package
folder with a copy of the package being removed, then it removes it from
the local folder\.
.
.SS "Linking"
When \fBnpm link\fR is run without any arguments in a package folder, then a
symbolic link is created from that folder to \fBroot/<name>/LINK\fR\|\.
Additionally, its package dependencies are installed to its
\|\./node_modules folder as necessary\.
.
.P
When \fBnpm link <name>\fR is run in another package folder, a symbolic
link is created from \fBroot/<name>/LINK\fR to \fB\|\./node_modules/<name>\fR, and
its dependencies are also installed if necessary\.  (Generally, it will
not be necessary, as the package will already have its own node_modules
folder containing its dependencies\.)
.
.P
When publishing, linked package dependencies are resolved to their
current state\.  It is assumed that the linked folder was linked for a
reason, and may contain changes required for the proper functioning of
the host program\.

.Not sure how this will work\.  Maybe linking simply isn\'t possible?
