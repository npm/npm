.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command will print to stdout all the versions of packages that are
either installed or available in the registry, with their tags and whether
or not they\'re active and/or stable\.
.
.P
To filter a single package or state, you can provide words to filter on
and highlight (if appropriate)\.  For instance, to see all the stable
packages, you could do this:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
npm ls stable
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Another common usage is to find the set of all packages that are 
installed\. This can be accomplished by doing this:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
npm ls installed
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Strings are matched using the JavaScript "split" function, so regular
expression strings are ok\.  However, the highlighting is a simple
split/join, so regexps probably won\'t get the funky colors\.
