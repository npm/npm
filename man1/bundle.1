.SH "NAME"
\fBnpm-bundle\fR \-\- Bundle package dependencies
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.
.nf
npm bundle [<cmd> \.\.\.]
.
.fi
.
.P
Run in a package folder\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When run in a package folder, this command can be used to install
package dependencies into the \fBnode_modules\fR folder\.
.
.P
When the package is installed, it will read dependencies from the local
bundle \fIbefore\fR reading any dependencies that are already installed\.
.
.P
Furthermore, when installing, npm will not attempt to install
dependencies that already exist in the bundle\.
.
.P
To bundle all the dependencies of a given package, run \fBnpm bundle\fR
without any arguments\.
.
.P
To operate on the bundle packages, any npm command and arguments may be
passed to the \fBnpm bundle\fR command\.  For example, to install a package
into the bundle, you can do \fBnpm bundle install express\fR\|\.
.
.P
To list the packages in the bundle, do \fBnpm bundle ls\fR\|\.  To remove bundled
packages, do \fBnpm bundle remove <whatever>\fR\|\.  Et cetera\.
.
.P
In this way, a command like \fBnpm bundle install http://github\.com/user/project/tarball/master\fR can be used
to have a dependency that is not published on the npm registry\.  (It still
must contain a package\.json, though, of course\.)
.
.SH "CAVEATS"
Bins and man pages are not installed by bundle\.
