.SH "NAME"
\fBnpm-bundle\fR \-\- REMOVED
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBnpm bundle\fR command has been removed in 1\.0, for the simple reason
that it is no longer necessary, as the default behavior is now to
install packages into the global space\.
.
.P
Just use \fBnpm install\fR now to do what \fBnpm bundle\fR used to do\.
