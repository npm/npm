Bernstein.\n\nFor the API, please consult the generated documentation under doc/ (you can run `make` to generate it).\n\nTo run the tests do the following on the console from the project's root directory:\n\n    $ npm install\n    $ make test\n\n\nContributors\n------------\n\nIf you are one of the contributors and want to add yourself or change the information here, please do submit a pull request.   Contributors appear in no particular order.\n\n### For the Curve25519 submodule\n\n* [Graydon Hoare](https://github.com/graydon): suggested clamping the private key by default for increased safety and uniformity with other implementations.\n* [liliakai](https://github.com/liliakai): spotted an unused argument in some of the functions\n* [RyanC](https://github.com/ryancdotorg): removed dependency of a function to the Javascript Math library\n* [Guy Kloss](https://github.com/pohutukawa): performance improvements through bit-shift operations, performance and conformance testing, documentation, compatibility with the npm package ecosystem, and more\n* [Michele Bini](https://github.com/rev22): originally wrote the Javascript implementation\n\n\nCopyright and MIT licensing\n---------------------------\n\n* Copyright (c) 2012 Ron Garret\n* Copyright (c) 2007, 2013, 2014 Michele Bini <michele.bini@gmail.com>\n* Copyright (c) 2014 Mega Limited\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
