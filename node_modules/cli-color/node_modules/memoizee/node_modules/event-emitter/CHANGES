v0.2.2  --  2013.06.05
* `unify` functionality

v0.2.1  --  2012.09.21
* hasListeners module
* Simplified internal id (improves performance a little), now it starts with
  underscore (hint it's private). Abstracted it to external module to have it
  one place
* Documentation cleanup

v0.2.0  --  2012.09.19
* Trashed poor implementation of v0.1 and came up with something solid

Changes:
* Improved performance
* Fixed bugs event-emitter is now cross-prototype safe and not affected by
  unexpected methods attached to Object.prototype
* Removed support for optional "emitter" argument in `emit` method, it was
  cumbersome to use, and should be solved just with event objects

v0.1.5  --  2012.08.06
* (maintanance) Do not use descriptors for internal objects, it exposes V8 bugs
  (only Node v0.6 branch)

v0.1.4  --  2012.06.13
* Fix detachment of listeners added with 'once'

v0.1.3  --  2012.05.28
* Updated es5-ext to latest version (v0.8)
* Cleared package.json so it's in npm friendly format

v0.1.2  --  2012.01.22
* Support for emitter argument in emit function, this allows some listeners not
  to be notified about event
* allOff - removes all listeners from object
* All methods returns self object
* Internal fixes
* Travis CI integration

v0.1.1  --  2011.08.08
* Added TAD test suite to devDependencies, configured test commands.
