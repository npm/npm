## new

* New properties:
  * `from` indicates how we parsed this specifier, values are:
    localArgument, local, hosted, url and registry.

    _localArgument_ differs from _local_ in that it means the argument
    parsing rules were used instead of the dependency parsing rules. That is, the
    rules for `npm install /foo` instead of those for `"dependencies":
    {"foo": "file:/foo"}`.

* Changed properties:
  * `type` indicates what sort of specifier this is, values are: file, directory, git, remote, version, range, tag.

* Local specifiers:
  * Trailing spaces on local specifiers are no longer trimmed.
  * The `spec` field for local specifiers is now a fully resolved path.
  * The type is now _file_ or _directory, never _local_.
* Git specifiers:
  * The leading `git+` is no longer stripped. This makes the behavior match
    `hosted-git-info`.
* Hosted git specifiers:
  * The `type` is now _git_. You can check if something is hosted by looking at the `hosted` property or checking to see if `from` is _hosted_.
