It bundles the [gyp](https://code.google.com/p/gyp/)\nproject used by the Chromium team and takes away the pain of dealing with the\nvarious differences in build platforms. It is the replacement to the `node-waf`\nprogram which is removed for node `v0.8`. If you have a native addon for node that\nstill has a `wscript` file, then you should definitely add a `binding.gyp` file\nto support the latest versions of node.\n\nMultiple target versions of node are supported (i.e. `0.8`, ..., `4`, `5`, `6`,\netc.), regardless of what version of node is actually installed on your system\n(`node-gyp` downloads the necessary development files or headers for the target version).\n\n#### Features:\n\n * Easy to use, consistent interface\n * Same commands to build your module on every platform\n * Supports multiple target versions of Node\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install -g node-gyp\n```\n\nYou will also need to install:\n\n  * On Unix:\n    * `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is __*not*__ supported)\n    * `make`\n    * A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org)\n  * On Mac OS X:\n    * `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is __*not*__ supported) (already installed on Mac OS X)\n    * [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)\n      * You also need to install the `Command Line Tools` via Xcode. You can find this under the menu `Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads`\n      * This step will install `gcc` and the related toolchain containing `make`\n  * On Windows:\n    * Visual C++ Build Environment:\n      * Option 1: Install [Visual C++ Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) using the **Default Install** option.\n\n      * Option 2: Install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs) (or modify an existing installation) and select *Common Tools for Visual C++* during setup. This also works with the free Community and Express for Desktop editions.\n\n      > :bulb: [Windows Vista / 7 only] requires [.NET Framework 4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773)\n\n    * Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (`v3.x.x` is not supported), and run `npm config set python python2.7` (or see below for further instructions on specifying the proper Python version and path.)\n    * Launch cmd, `npm config set msvs_version 2015`\n\n    If the above steps didn't work for you, please visit [Microsoft's Node.js Guidelines for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#compiling-native-addon-modules) for additional tips.\n\nIf you have multiple Python versions installed, you can identify which Python\nversion `node-gyp` uses by setting the '--python' variable:\n\n``` bash\n$ node-gyp --python /path/to/python2.7\n```\n\nIf `node-gyp` is called by way of `npm` *and* you have multiple versions of\nPython installed, then you can set `npm`'s 'python' config key to the appropriate\nvalue:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm config set python /path/to/executable/python2.7\n```\n\nNote that OS X is just a flavour of Unix and so needs `python`, `make`, and C/C++.\nAn easy way to obtain these is to install XCode from Apple,\nand then use it to install the command line tools (under Preferences -> Downloads).\n\nHow to Use\n----------\n\nTo compile your native addon, first go to its root directory:\n\n``` bash\n$ cd my_node_addon\n```\n\nThe next step is to generate the appropriate project build files for the current\nplatform. Use `configure` for that:\n\n``` bash\n$ node-gyp configure\n```\n\n__Note__: The `configure` step looks for the `binding.gyp` file in the current\ndirectory to process. See below for instructions on creating the `binding.gyp` file.\n\nNow you will have either a `Makefile` (on Unix platforms) or a `vcxproj` file\n(on Windows) in the `build/` directory. Next invoke the `build` command:\n\n``` bash\n$ node-gyp build\n```\n\nNow you have your compiled `.node` bindings file! The compiled bindings end up\nin `build/Debug/` or `build/Release/`, depending on the build mode. At this point\nyou can require the `.node` file with Node and run your tests!\n\n__Note:__ To create a _Debug_ build of the bindings file, pass the `--debug` (or\n`-d`) switch when running either the `configure`, `build` or `rebuild` command.\n\n\nThe \"binding.gyp\" file\n----------------------\n\nPreviously when node had `node-waf` you had to write a `wscript` file. The\nreplacement for that is the `binding.gyp` file, which describes the configuration\nto build your module in a JSON-like format. This file gets placed in the root of\nyour package, alongside the `package.json` file.\n\nA barebones `gyp` file appropriate for building a node addon looks like:\n\n``` python\n{\n  \"targets\": [\n    {\n      \"target_name\": \"binding\",\n      \"sources\": [ \"src/binding.cc\" ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSome additional resources for addons and writing `gyp` files:\n\n * [\"Going Native\" a nodeschool.io tutorial](http://nodeschool.io/#goingnative)\n * [\"Hello World\" node addon example](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/test/addons/hello-world)\n * [gyp user documentation](https://gyp.gsrc.io/docs/UserDocumentation.md)\n * [gyp input format reference](https://gyp.gsrc.io/docs/InputFormatReference.md)\n * [*\"binding.gyp\" files out in the wild* wiki page](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/wiki/%22binding.gyp%22-files-out-in-the-wild)\n\n\nCommands\n--------\n\n`node-gyp` responds to the following commands:\n\n| **Command**   | **Description**\n|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------\n| `help`        | Shows the help dialog\n| `build`       | Invokes `make`/`msbuild.exe` and builds the native addon\n| `clean`       | Removes the `build` directory if it exists\n| `configure`   | Generates project build files for the current platform\n| `rebuild`     | Runs `clean`, `configure` and `build` all in a row\n| `install`     | Installs node header files for the given version\n| `list`        | Lists the currently installed node header versions\n| `remove`      | Removes the node header files for the given version\n\n\nCommand Options\n--------\n\n`node-gyp` accepts the following command options:\n\n| **Command**                       | **Description**\n|:----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------\n| `-j n`, `--jobs n`                | Run make in parallel\n| `--target=v6.2.1`                 | Node version to build for (default=process.version)\n| `--silly`, `--loglevel=silly`     | Log all progress to console\n| `--verbose`, `--loglevel=verbose` | Log most progress to console\n| `--silent`, `--loglevel=silent`   | Don't log anything to console\n| `debug`, `--debug`                | Make Debug build (default=Release)\n| `--release`, `--no-debug`         | Make Release build\n| `-C $dir`, `--directory=$dir`     | Run command in different directory\n| `--make=$make`                    | Override make command (e.g. gmake)\n| `--thin=yes`                      | Enable thin static libraries\n| `--arch=$arch`                    | Set target architecture (e.g. ia32)\n| `--tarball=$path`                 | Get headers from a local tarball\n| `--ensure`                        | Don't reinstall headers if already present\n| `--dist-url=$url`                 | Download header tarball from custom URL\n| `--proxy=$url`                    | Set HTTP proxy for downloading header tarball\n| `--cafile=$cafile`                | Override default CA chain (to download tarball)\n| `--nodedir=$path`                 | Set the path to the node binary\n| `--python=$path`                  | Set path to the python (2) binary\n| `--msvs_version=$version`         | Set Visual Studio version (win)\n| `--solution=$solution`            | Set Visual Studio Solution version (win)\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n\n[python-v2.7.10]: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/\n[msvc2013]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=44914\n[win7sdk]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279\n[compiler update for the Windows SDK 7.1]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4422\n",
