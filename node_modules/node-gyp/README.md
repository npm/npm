node-gyp
=========
### Node.js native addon build tool

`node-gyp` is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling
native addon modules for Node.js, which takes away the pain of dealing with the
various differences in build platforms. It is the replacement to the `node-waf`
program which is removed for node `v0.8`. If you have a native addon for node that
still has a `wscript` file, then you should definitely add a `binding.gyp` file
to support the latest versions of node.

Multiple target versions of node are supported (i.e. `0.6`, `0.7`,..., `1.0`,
etc.), regardless of what version of node is actually installed on your system
(`node-gyp` downloads the necessary development files for the target version).

#### Features:

 * Easy to use, consistent interface
 * Same commands to build your module on every platform
 * Supports multiple target versions of Node


Installation
------------

You can install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install -g node-gyp
```

You will also need to install:

  * On Unix:
    * `python`
    * `make`
    * A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like GCC
  * On Windows:
    * [Python][windows-python] ([`v2.7.2`][windows-python-v2.7.2] recommended, `v3.x.x` not yet supported)
    * Microsoft Visual C++ ([Express][msvc] version works well)

How to Use
----------

To compile your native addon, first go to its root directory:

``` bash
$ cd my_node_addon
```

The next step is to generate the appropriate project build files for the current
platform. Use `configure` for that:

``` bash
$ node-gyp configure
```

__Note__: The `configure` step looks for the `binding.gyp` file in the current
directory to processs. See below for instructions on creating the `binding.gyp` file.

Now you will have either a `Makefile` (on Unix platforms) or a `vcxproj` file
(on Windows) in the `build/` directory. Next invoke the `build` command:

``` bash
$ node-gyp build
```

Now you have your compiled `.node` bindings file! The compiled bindings end up
in `build/Debug/` or `buld/Release/`, depending on the build mode. At this point
you can require the `.node` file with Node and run your tests!

__Note:__ To create a _Debug_ build of the bindings file, pass the `--debug` (or
`-d`) switch when running the either `configure` or `build` command.


The "gyp" file
--------------

Previously when node had `node-waf` you had to write a `wscript` file. The
replacement for that is the `binding.gyp` file, which describes the configuration
to build your module in a JSON-like format. A barebones `gyp` file appropriate for
building a node addon looks like:

``` json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "target_name": "binding",
      "sources": [ "src/binding.cc" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Commands
--------

`node-gyp` responds to the following commands:

 * `build` - Invokes `make`/`msbuild.exe` and builds the native addon
 * `clean` - Removes any generated project files and the `out` dir
 * `configure` - Generates project build files for the current platform
 * `rebuild` - Runs "clean", "configure" and "build" all at once
 * `install` - Installs node development files for the given version.
 * `list` - Lists the currently installed node development file versions
 * `remove` - Removes a node development files for a given version
