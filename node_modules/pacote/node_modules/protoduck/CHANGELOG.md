### BREAKING CHANGES

* **api:** The API was significantly overhauled.

* New protocol creating is now through protoduck.define() instead of protoduck()
* Implementations are through Duck#impl instead of Duck(...)
* The `private` option was removed
* Static protocols were removed -- only method-style protocols are available now.
* As part of that: the target argument to impl can no longer be omitted
* The main export object is now the metaobject. protoduck.impl can be used to extend to MOP
* .isDerivable is now a property on Duck instances, not a static method
* .hasImpl is now a method on Duck instances, not a static method
* Protoduck will now genfunnify existing functions as default methods for genfuns declared in a protocol when implementing
* Error messages have been overhauled to be more helpful
* **deps:** nextMethod is now an extra argument to methods
* **meta:** node@<4 is no longer supported
