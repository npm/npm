## v6.0.0 (2018-03-23):

Sometimes major releases are a big splash, sometimes they're something
smaller.  This is the latter kind.  That said, we expect to keep this in
release candidate status until Node 10 ships at the end of April.  There
will likely be a few more features for the 6.0.0 release line between now
and then.  We do expect to have a bigger one later this year though, so keep
an eye out for npm@7!

### UPDATE AND OUTDATED

When `npm install` is finding a version to install, it first checks to see
if the specifier you requested matches the `latest` tag.  If it doesn't,
then it looks for the highest version that does.  This means you can do
release candidates on tags other than `latest` and users won't see them
unless they ask for them.  Promoting them is as easy as setting the `latest`
tag to point at them.

Historically `npm update` and `npm outdated` worked differently.  They just
looked for the most recent thing that matched the semver range, disregarding
the `latest` tag. We're changing it to match `npm install`'s behavior.

  Make update and outdated respect latest interaction with semver as install does.

### PLUS ONE SMALLER PATCH

Technically this is a bug fix, but the change in behavior is enough of an
edge case that I held off on bringing it in until a major version.

When we extract a binary and it starts with a shebang (or "hash bang"), that
is, something like:

```
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

If the file has Windows line endings we strip them off of the first line. 
The reason for this is that shebangs are only used in Unix-like environments
and the files with them can't be run if the shebang has a Windows line ending.

Previously we converted ALL line endings from Windows to Unix.  With this
patch we only convert the line with the shebang.  (Node.js works just fine
with either set of line endings.)

  Only rewrite the CR after a shebang (if any) when fixing up CR/LFs.
