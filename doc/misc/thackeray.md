INTRODUCTORY NOTE.



The first contribution to Punch by Thackeray appears to
have been Miss Tickletoh]/ s Lectures on English History,
which was published, with twenty-three Hlustrations by the
author, in the third volume of Punch, This was in 1842.
His last contribution was Letters from the East by our own
BashirBazouk, in 1864. Within these twelve years, he
wrote for the weekly jester not only several considerable
series of papers like Jeames^s Diary and Mr. Brown^s Let-
ters to a Young Man about Town, but a great variety of
poems, burlesques, smdjeux d' esprit in general. When he
collected his Miscellanies in 1856 he reprinted a selection
of these contributions, and they are to be found distributed
in volumes v., vi., vii., xiii., and xix. of this series. After
his death, when a definitive edition of his works was pub-
lished in London, a volume of Contributions to Punch was
included, of which this volume is a reprint, with the addi-
tion of several papers omitted, it is difBlcult to say why,
from that collection. There can be but very few of Thack-
eray's contributions to Punch which are not to be found in
the volumes of this series.

If Fraser^s Magazine was of double service to him in af-
fording him an income and training him for novel-writing.
Punch likewise was a happy vehicle of his wit and satire
and a steady resource. The weekly journal, indeed, did him



VI INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

this service, that it made the monthly magazine less impor-
tant, and contributions to a monthly stand more in the way
of one^s novel-writing than do the quickly written squibs
for the weekly. There was, too, more chance for gayety in
the jetix d' esprit which Thackeray dashed off ; and though
his seriousness and his almost morbid passion for honesty
made him a satirist, his tenderness made him eager for fun
and nonsense. " I hate Juvenal," he says in one of his let-
ters to James Hannay ; " I mean I think him a truculent
brute ; and I love Horace better than you do, and rate
Churchill much lower ; and as for Swift, you haven't made
me alter my opinion. I admire, or rather admit, his power
as much as you do ; but I don't admire that kind of power
so much as I did fifteen years ago, or twenty, shall we say.
Love is a higher intellectual exercise than Hatred; and
when you get one or two more of those young ones you
write so pleasantly about, you'll come over to the kind
ways, I think, rather than the cruel ones."

Dr. John Brown, in his paper on Thackerarfs Literary
Career^ has given a pleasing account of the appreciative rec-
ognition of Thackeray by some Edinburgh readers at a time
when the author was especially in need of cheer. " There
happened," he says, " to be placed in the window of an
Edinburgh jeweller a silver statuette of Mr. Punch, with his
dress en rigueur, — his comfortable and tidy paunch, with
all its buttons ; his hunch ; his knee-breeches with their ties ;
his compact little legs, one foot a little forward ; and the
intrepid and honest, kindly little fellow firmly set on his
pins, with his customary look of up to and good for any-
thing. In his hand was his weapon, a pen ; his skull was
an inkhom, and his cap its lid. A passer-by — who had
long been grateful to our author [was not this the kindly
doctor himself ?], as to a dear, unknown and enriching

friend, for his writings in Fraser and in Punch, and had
longed for some way of reaching him, and telling him how
his work was relished and valued — bethought himself of
sending this inkstand to Mr. Thackeray. He went in and
asked its price. ^ Ten guineas, sir.' He said to himself,
* There are many who feel as I do ; why shouldn't we send
him up to him ? I'll get eighty several half-crowns, and
that will do it ' (he had ascertained that there would be dis-
count for ready money). With the help of a friend, who says
he awoke to Thackeray, and divined his great future, when
he came one evening, in Fraser for May, 1844, on the word
kinopium, the half-crowns were soon forthcoming ; and it is
pleasant to remember, that in the ^ octogint ' are the names
of Lord Jeffrey and Sir William Hamilton, who gave their
half-crowns with the heartiest goodwill. A short note was
written telling the story. The little man in silver was duly
packed, and sent with the following inscription round the

base : —

" To this the following reply was made : —

" * 13 Young Street, Kensington Square,

3/ay 11,1848.

" ' My dear Sir, — The arms and the man arrived in
safety yesterday, and I am glad to know the names of two
of the eighty Edinburgh friends who have taken such a kind
method of showing their goodwill towards me. If you are
grati, I am gratior. Such tokens of regard and sympathy
are very precious to a writer like myself, who have some

Viu INTRODUCTORY NOTE,

been good enough to find out in Edinburgh, that under the
mask satirical there walks about a sentimental gentleman
who means not unkindly to any mortal person. I can see
exactly the same expression under the vizard of my little
friend in silver, and hope some day to shake the whole octo-
gint by the hand gratos and gratas, and thank them for their
friendliness and regard. I think I had best say no more on
the subject, lest I should be tempted into some enthusias-
tic writing of which I am afraid. I assure you these tokens
of what I can't help acknowledging as popularity make me
humble as well as grateful, and make me feel an almost aw-
ful sense of the responsibility which falls upon a man in
such a station. Is it deserved or undeserved? Who is this
that sets up to preach to mankind, and to laugh at many
things which men reverence ? I hope I may be able to tell
the truth always, and to see it aright, according to the eyes
which God Almighty gives me. And if, in the exercise of
my calling, I get friends, and find encouragement and sym-
pathy, I need not tell you how much I feel and am thank-
ful for this support. Indeed, I can't reply lightly upon
this subject, or feel otherwise than very grave, when people
begin to praise me as you do. Wishing you and my Edin-
burgh friends all health and happiness, believe me, my dear
sir, most faithfully yours,

" ' W. M. Thackeray.' "

Although, as we have said, Thackeray wrote a series of
papers for Punch in 1854, his continuous work practically
ceased four years earlier with his Ballads of Policeman X.
The absorption in larger works and the occupation of lec-
turing appear to have with drawn him from this weekly work.

Boston, October, 1889.

2 CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUNCH,

determined, although with regret, to turn away the lad,
when he prevented that step on their part by signifying his
own intention to retire. His grandmother, who, we are led
to believe, kept a small shop in the town of York, left
Adolphus a fortune of three hundred pounds in the Three
per Cents, which sum he thought fully adequate for the
making of his fortune in his own way.

His passion was to become an editor of a Magazine ; to
assemble about him "the great spirits of the age," as he
called them ; and to be able to communicate his own con-
tributions to the public, aided by all the elegances of type,
and backed by all the ingenuities of puffery.

That celebrated miscellany, the "Lady's Lute,'' then
being for sale — indeed, if a gentleman has a mind to part
with his money, it is very hard if he cannot find some peri-
odical with a broom at its masthead — Adolphus, for the sum
of forty-five pounds, became the proprietor and editor of
the " Lute ; " and had great pleasure in seeing his own
name in the most Gothic capitals upon the title-page — his
poems occupying the place of honor within. The honest
fellow had some good mercantile notions, and did not in the
least hesitate to say, on the part of the proprietors, and on
the fly-leaf of the Magazine, that the Public of England
would rejoice to learn, that the great aid of Adolphus
SiMCOE, Esquire, had been secured, at an immense ex-
pense, for the " Lady's Lute ; " that his contributions would
henceforth be solely confined to it, and that the delighted
world would have proofs of his mighty genius in song.

Having got all the poets by heart, he had a pretty knack
of imitating them all, and in a single ballad would give you
specimens of at least half-a^iozen different styles. He had,
moreover, an emphatic way of his own, which was for a
little time popular ; and the public, for near a year, may be
said to have been almost taken in by Adolphus Simcoe —
as they have been by other literary characters of his kind.
It is, we do believe, a fact, that for a certain time Adol-
phus's Magazine actually paid its contributors; and it is
a known truth, that one India-paper proof of the portrait
of himself which he published in the second year of his
editorship, was bought by a young lady, a sincere admirer
of his poems.

In the course of eighteen months he exhausted his manu-
script ledger of poetry — he published his " Ghoul," a poem
in Lord Byron's style; his "Leila," after the manner of



MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES. 3

Thomas Moore ; his " Idiosyncrasy," a didactic poem, that
strongly reminded one of Wordsworth ; and his " Gondola,
a Venetian Lay," that may be considered to be slightly
similar to the works of L. E. L. Then he came out with a
Tragedy, called " Perdition, or the Eosicrucian Gammons,"
of which the dulness was so portentous, that at the end of
the fourth act it was discovered there were not more than
thirty-three subscribers left to the Magazine.

Suffice it to say, that though he continued the work des-
perately for six months longer, pouring, as he said, the
whole energies of his soul into its pages — (the fact was
that, as there was no more money, there were no more con-
tributors) — though he wrote articles pathetic, profound,
and humorous, commenced romances, and indited the most
bitter and sarcastic reviews, the " Lady's Lute " fell to the
ground — its chords, as he said, were rudely snapped
asunder, and he who had swept them with such joy went
forth a wretched and heartbroken man.

He passed three months in Her Majesty's Asylum of the
Fleet, from whence he issued in brocade robe-de-chambre,
and the possessor of the cut-glass bottles and shaving
trumpery of a dressing-case, the silver covers of which he
had pawned in order to subsist while in durance.

Our belief is that Miss Tickletoby is his relation : it is
certain that he sleeps in her back garret (and the venerable
age of the lady puts all scandal out of the question) ; he
has, we are fully certain, instructed her pupils in penman-
ship, filling up his leisure moments by writing what would
have been contributions to the Magazines, if those works
would but have accepted the same.

He still speaks of the " Lady's Lute " as of the greatest
periodical that ever was produced, and but the other day
apologized warmly to the writer of this for having abused
his early volume of Poems — "Lyrics of the Soul" they
were called — written at sixteen, when we were students at
the University of London. He persists in thinking that
the author of "Lyrics of the Soul" has never forgiven him,
that he has never been the same man since, but has pined
away under the effects of that withering sarcasm. Our
next work, he says, was the bitter Slough of Despair — it
was called "The Downy Dragsman; or. Love in Liquor-
pond Street." This, at least, the reader will remember.
Could anything be more frank than its humor — more joy-
ously low than every one of the scenes in that truly racy
production ?

It is needless to say, we have no sort of anger against
poor Adolphus ; but ttuit, on the contrary, meeting him very
wild and gloomy, and more than usually dirty, at the
" Globe," in Bow Street, which we both frequent, it was a
great pleasure to us to lend him seven shillings, which
enabled him to order a dish of meat in addition to that
unhappy half-pint of beer which seemed really to form all
his dinner.

The dinner and the money made him communicative;




and he was good enough to confide to us the history of a
vast number of his disappointments — "His blighted opes
— his withered dreams of hearly years — his ' vain hambi-
tion ' " (Adolphus is a Londoner, whatever his grandmother
may have been), and at the end of all, he pulled out a
manuscript (which is always rather a frightful object to
a literary man), but instead of reading it began, thank
Heaven ! only to discourse about it. It was another's writ-
ing, not his own.



MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES. 5

"Half red,'' said he, "you know I hoccupy no common
position in the literary world. I ave at least done so, until
misfortune hovertook me. Since my sorrows, I've been
kindly oused by a munificent being — a woman (' 'ere's to
'er,'" said he, draining his glass solemnly, "who doubles
hall our joys, and alves hall our sorrows — to woman!").
Having finished his brandy-and-water, he resumed : —

"Hever since hi've been in the ouse of that hangelic
being — she's hold. Half red, hold enough to be my grand-
mother, and so I pray you let the sneer pass away from
your lips — hi've not neglected, has you may himagine, the
sacred calling for which hi feel hi was born. Poesy has
been my solace in my lonely hagonies, hand I've tried the
newspapers hall round. But they're a callous and ard-
earted set, those literary men — men who have feasted at my
table, and quaffed of my wine-cup, — men, who in the days of
my prosperity have grown rich from my purse — will you
believe it, they won't accept a single harticle of my writing,
and scornfully pass me by ! Worse than this — they refuse
to elp me by the most simple puff, for me and mine ; would
you believe it, my dear friend, Miss Tickletoby has just
commenced a series of lectures, for which hi'm hanxious to
get the world's good opinion, and not one paper will hin-
sert the little description I've written off. The Hage, the
Hargus, the Hera, hi've applied to 'em all, and they're hall
the same — hall, hall, ungrateful."

" My dear fellow, if you will write verse," said I —

"It's not verse," answered Adolphus, "it's prose — a
report of Miss T's lecture, prefaced by a modest leading
harticle."

" I'll see if I can get it into Funch,^^ said I.

"Hush, Punch !^^ shouted he, "Heavens, have you fallen
so low ? I, write in Punch I Gracious powers ! In Punch
— in Punch ! "

"Rum or brandy, sir?" said Betsy, the waiter, who
caught the last word.

" Rum,^^ said Adolphus (with a good deal of presence of
mind) ; and, as he drank the steaming liquor, took my
hand. " Half red," said he, " tell me this one thing — does
Punch pay? for, between ourselves, Miss Tickletoby says
that she'll turn me out of doors unless I can make myself
useful to her and — pay my bill."

Adolphus Simcoe is to be paid for his contributions, and
next week we shall begin Miss Tickletoby's Lectures.

LECTURE I.

WE have just had the joy to be present at one of the
most splendid exhibitions of intelligence which
has been witnessed in our splendid and intelligent time.

The great spirit of History, distilled in a mighty mind's
alembic, outpouring, clear, rich, strong, intoxicating oft —
BO delicious was the draught, and so eager the surrounding
drinkers — the figui*es of statesmen and heroes, wise heroes
and heroic statesmen, caught up from their darkness in the
far past, and made by the enchantress to shine before us
visible; the gorgeous and gigantic memories of old Time
rising stately from their graves, and looking on us as in life
they looked: such were the thoughts, sensations, visions,
that we owe to the eloquence of Miss Tickletoby this day.

We write under a tremendous emotion, for the words of
the fair speaker still thrill in our ears ; nor can we render
account of one tithe part of that mystic harmony of words,
that magic spell of poesy, which the elegant oratrix flung
round her audience — a not readily-to-be-dissipated charm.

Suffice it to say that, pursuant to her announcements in
the public prints, this accomplished lady commenced her
series of lectures on English History to-day. Her friends,
her pupils, those who know and esteem her (and these
consist of the rarest of England's talent, and the brightest
of her aristocracy), were assembled at one o'clock punctu-
ally in her modest dwelling (No. 3 Leg-of-Veal Court, Little
Britain, over the greengrocer's ; pull the third bell from
the bottom). We were among the first to attend, and
gladly give the publicity of our columns to a record of the
glorious transactions of the day. The reporters of this paper
were employed in taking down every word that fell from
the speaker's lips — (would that they could have likewise
transferred the thrilling tones and magic glance which
made her words a thousand times more precious) : we, on
the other hand, being from our habits more accustomed to
philosophic abbreviation, have been contented with taking
down rather the heads and the suggestivity (if we may use



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES. 7

the phi-ase) of Miss Tickletoby's discourse, and we flat-
tei- ourselves tliat upon a comparison with tlie text, the
analysis will be found singularly faithful.

We have spoken of the public character: a word now
regai-ding Miss Tickletoby the woman. She has long been
known and loved in the quarter of which she is the greatest
blessing and ornament — that of St, Maiy Axe.

From her earlj' life practising tuition, some of the best
families of the City owe to her their eai-liest introduction to
letters. Her Spelling-book is well known, and has iiin
through very neai'ly an edition ; and when we rank among
her pupils the daughter of one of the clerks of Alderman
Harmer and a niece of a late honored Lokd Matok,
we have said enough to satisfy the most fastidious votary
of fashion with respect to the worldly position of those who
sit at Miss Tickletoby's feet.




Miss Tickletoby believes that education, to be effective,
should be begun early, and therefore receives her pupils
from the age of two upwards. Nay, she has often
laughingly observed that she would have no objection to
take them from the month, as childhood's training can
never be too soon commenced. Of course, at so tender an
age, sex is no consideration. Miss Tickletoby's children
(as she lovea to call them) are both of the sterner and the
softer varieties of our human species.



8 CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUNCH.

With regard to her educational system, it is slightly co-
ercive. She has none of the new-fangled notions regarding
the inutility of corporal punishments, but, remembering
their effects in her own case, does not hesitate to apply
them whenever necessity urges.

On Wednesdays (half-holidays) she proposes to deliver a
series of lectures upon English history, occasionally (it
would appear from a hint in the present discourse) diver-
sified by subjects of a lighter and more holiday kind. We
shall attend them all — nor can the public of this city do
better than follow our example. The price of tickets for
the six lectures is — ninepence.

Can such things be.
And overcome us like a summer cloud
Without our special wonder ?



THE LECTURE-ROOM.

The lecture was announced for one o'clock, and arriving
at that hour, we found the room full of rank and fashion.
Excellent accommodation was arranged for the public press.
Flowers, some of those cheap but lovely and odorous ones
which form the glory of England's garden, were placed
tastefully here and there — on the mantel, on the modest
table at which stood the lecturer's chair, and a large and
fragrant bouquet in the window-sill. These were (with the
exception of a handsome curtain that hung before the door
from which Miss Tickletoby was to issue) the sole orna-
ments of the simple academic chamber.

The lovely children, with wistful eyes and cheeks more
flushed than any roses there, were accommodated with their
usual benches, while their parents were comfortably ranged
in chairs behind them. 'Twas indeed a thrilling sight — a
sight to bring tears into the philanthropic heart — happy
tears though — such as those spring showers which fall
from the lids of childhood, and which rainbow joy speedily
dries up again.

The bell rings: one moment — and the chintz curtain
draws aside ; and 'midst waving of kerchiefs, and shouting
of bravos, and with smiling eyes fixed upon her, and young
hearts to welcome her, the Lecturer steps forth. Now,
our task is over. Gentles, let the enchantress speak for
herself.



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES. 9

Having cleared her voice, and gazing round the room
with a look of affection, she began



THE LECTURE.

My Loves, — With regard to the early history of our be-
loved country, before King Alfred ascended the throne, I
have vei"^' little indeed to say 5 in the first place, because
the story itself is none of the most moral — consisting of
accounts of murders agreeably varied by invasions; and
secondly, dears, because, to tell you the truth, I have al-
ways found those first chapters so abominably stupid, that I
have made a point to pass them over. For I had an indul-
gent Mamma, who did not look to my education so much as
I do to yours, and provided she saw Howell's " Medulla " be-
fore me, never thought of looking to see whether " Mother
Goose '' was within the leaves. Ah, dears ! that is a plear
sant history, too, and in holiday time we will have a look
at that.

Well, then, about the abominable, odious Danes and
Saxons, the Picts and the Scots, I know very little, and
must say have passed thi'ough life pretty comfortably in
spite of my ignorance. Not that this should be an excuse
to you — no, no, darlings ; learn for learning's sake ; if not,
I have something hanging up in the cupboard, and you
know my name is Tickletoby. [ Ghreat sensation.l

How first our island became inhabited is a point which
nobody knows. I do not believe a word of that story
at the beginning of the "Seven Champions of Christen-
dom," about King Brute and his companions ; and as for
the other hypotheses (Let Miss Biggs spell the word
"hypothesis," and remember not to confound it with
"apothecary") they are not worth consideration. For as
the first man who entered the island could not write, de-
pend on it he never set down the date of his arrival ; and I
leave you to guess what a confusion about dates there
would speedily be — you who can't remember whether it

ding for dinner.

Those little dears who have not seen Mrs. Trimmer's
" History of England " have, no doubt, beheld pictures of
Mr. Oldridge's Balm of Columbia. The ancient Britons
were like the lady represented there, only not black ; the

excellent Mrs. T.'s pictures of these, no doubt, are au-
thentic, and there our ancestors are represented as dressed
in painted skins, and wearing their hair as long as pos-
sible. I need not say that it was their own skins they
painted, because, as for clothes, they were not yet in-
vented.

Perhaps some of my darlings have seen at their papas'
evening parties some curious (female) Britons who exist in
our own time, and who, out of respect for the country in
which they were born, are very fond of the paint, and not
at all partial to clothes.

As for the religion of the ancient Britons, as it was a false
and abominable superstition, the less we say about it the
better. If they had a religion, you may be sure they had
a clergy. This body of persons were called Druids. The
historian Hume says that they instructed the youth of the
country, which, considering not one boy in 1,000,000,000,000
could read, couldn't give the Druids much trouble. The
Druids likewise superintended the law matters and gov-
ernment of Britain ; and, in return for their kindness, were
handsomely paid, as all teachers of youth, lawyers, and
ministers ought to be. [" Hear^ hear^^ from Lord Abin-
GBR avd Sir Robert Peel.]

The ancient Britons were of a warlike, rude nature (and
loved broils and battles, like Master Spry yonder). They
used to go forth with clubs for weapons, and bulls' horns
for trumpets ; and so with their clubs and trumps they
would engage their enemies, who sometimes conquered
them, and sometimes were conquered by them, according to
luck.

The priests remained at home and encouraged them;
praying to their gods, and longing no doubt for a shai*e of
the glory and danger ; but they learned, they said, to sacri-
fice themselves for the public good. Nor did they only
sacrifice themselves — I grieve to say that it was their cus-
tom to sacrifice other people : for when the Britons re-
turned from war with their prisoners, the priests carried the
latter into certain mysterious groves, where they slew them
on the horrid altars of their gods. The gods, they said,
delighted in these forests and these dreadful human sacri-
fices, and you will better remember the facts by my repre-
senting these gods to you as so many wicked Lovegroves,
and their victims as unfortunate Whitebait. {Immense sen-
sation,']

And as your papas have probably taken some of you to
see the opera of "Norma," which relates to these very
Druids that we are talking about, you will know that the
ancient Britons had not only priests, but priestesses — that
is, clergywomen. Eemember this, and don't commit an
error which is common in society, and talk of two clerical
gentlemen as two priestesses. It is a gross blunder. One
might as well speak of the " Blue Posteses " (in Cork Street,
Burlington Gardens, where, I am told, excellent beef-steaks
are served), or talk of having your breakfasteses, as I have

heard the Duchess of often do. Eemember, then,

Priests ; singular. Priest. " Blue Posts " (Cork Street,
Burlington Gardens) ; singular, " Blue Post." " Break-
fasts," singular — What is the singular of Breakfasts, Miss
Higgins ?

Miss Higgins. I don't know.

Master Smith (delighted and eager). I know.

Miss Tickletohy. Speak, my dear, and tell that in-
attentive Miss Higgins what is the singular of "break-
fasts." ^ "...

Master Smith (clearing his voice by rubbing his jacket
sleeve across his nose). The most singular breakfast / know
is old John Wapshot's, who puts sugar in his muffins, and
takes salt in his tea ! [Master Smith was preparing to
ascend to the head of the class, but was sternly checked by
Miss TiCKLETOBY, who resumed her discourse.'}

It was not to be supposed that the wickedness of these
priests could continue for ever: and accordingly we find
(though upon my word I don't know upon what authority)
that, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven years ago, Julius
Caesar, that celebrated military man, landed at Deal. He
conquered a great number of princes with jaw-breaking
names, as did the Koman Emperors, his successors, such as
the Trinobantes, the Atrebates, the Silures, all richly de-
serving their fate, doubtless, as I fear they were but sav-
ages at best. They were masters of the Britons for pretty
near five hundred years, and though the Scotch pretend
that the Komans never conquered their part of it, I am in-
clined to suppose it was pretty much for the reasons that
the clothes are not taken off a scarecrow in the fields, be-
cause they are not worth the taking.

About the year 450, the Eomans, having quite enough
to do at home, quitted Britain for good, when the Scots,
who were hungry then, and have been hungry ever since,

rushed in among the poor unprotected Britoners, who were
forced to call the Saxons to their aid.

'Twas two o'clock — the Lecturer made her curtsey and
reminded her auditory that another Lecture would take
place on the following Wednesday, and the company de-
parted, each making a mental affidavit to return.

my darlings, of reporting words (hers were very abusive
against the Romans) — of reporting words that never were
uttered? There's scandal enougl^ loves, in this wicked
world without going back to old stories : real scandal, too,
which may satisfy any person. Nor did I mention King
Caractacus's noble behavior before the Roman Emperor
Claudius — for that history is so abominably stale that I
am sure none of my blessed loves require to be told it.

When the Britons had been deserted by the Romans, and
found themselves robbed and pillaged by the Picts and
Scots, they sent over to a people called Saxons (so called
because they didn't live in Saxony) : who came over to help
their friends, and having turned out the Picts and Scots,
and finding the country a pleasant one to dwell in, they
took possession of it, saying that the Britons did not de-
serve to have a country, as they did not know how to keep
it. This sort of argument was considered very just in
those days — and I've seen some little boys in this school
acting Saxon-fashion : for instance. Master Spry the other
day took away a piece of gingerbread from Master Jones,
giving him a great thump on the nose instead ; and what
was the consequence ? I showed Master Spry the injustice
of his action, and punished him severely.

To Master Spry. How did I punish you, my dear ? —
tell the company.

Master Spry, You kept the gingerbread.

Miss T, (severely), I don't mean that : how else did I
punish you ?

Master Spry. You vipped me : but I kicked your shins
all the time.

Unruly boy ! — but so it is, ladies and gentlemen, in the
infancy of individuals as in that of nations : we hear of
these continual scenes of violence, until prudence teaches
respect for property and law becomes stronger than force.
To return to the Saxons, they seized upon the goods and
persons of the effeminate Britons, made the latter their
slaves, and sold them as such in foreign countries. The
mind shudders at such horrors I How should you like,
you naughty Master Spry, to be seized and carried from
your blessed mother's roof — [immense sensation, and audi-
ble sobbing among the ladies present^ — how should you like
to be carried off and sold as a slave to France or Italy ?

Master Spry, Is there any schools there ? I shouldn't
mind if there ain't.

Miss T. Yes, sir, there are schools — and bods.

[_Im.mense uproar. Cries of "Shame/ " "No fiog-

their parents' cot, in the far Northern Isle, sighii^ and
yearning, no doubt, for the green fields of Albin ! *

It happened that a gentleman by the name of Grregory,



MISS TICKLETOBrS LECTURES, 17

who afterwards rose to be Pope of Kome — but who was
then a simple clerical gent, passed through the market, with
his friends, and came to the spot where these poor British
children stood.

The Reverend Mr. Gregory was instantly struck by their
appearance — by their rosy cheeks, their golden hair ; their
little jackets covered all over with sugar-loaf buttons, their
poor nankeens grown all too short by constant wash and
wear: and demanded of their owner, of what nation the
little darlings were ?

The men (who spoke in Latin) replied that they were
Angli, that is. Angles or English.

" Ajigles," said the enthusiastic Mr. Gregory, " they are
not Angles, but Angels ; '' and with this joke, which did
not do much honor to his head, though certainly his heart
was good, he approached the little dears, caressed them,
and made still further inquiries regarding them.*

Miss Pontifex {one of the little girls). And did Mr.
Gregory take the little children out of slavery, and send
them home, ma'am ?

Mr. Hume, my dear good little girl, does not mention this
fact ; but let us hope he did : with all my heart, I'm sure /
hope he did. But this is certain, that he never forgot them,
and when in process of time he came to be Pope of
Rome —

Master Maximus Pontifex, Pa says my name's Lat'n for
Pope of Rome : is it, ma'am ?

I've no doubt it is, my love, since your papa says so : and
when Gregory became Pope of Rome, he despatched a num-
ber of his clergy to England, who came and converted the be-
nighted Saxons and Britons, and they gave up their hideous
idols, and horrid human sacrifices, and sent the wicked
Druids about their business.

The Saxons had ended by becoming complete masters of
the country, and the people were now called Anglo or Eng-
lish Saxons. There were a great number of small sover-
eigns in the land then : but about the year 830, the King
called Egbert became the master of the whole country 5 and
he, my loves, was the father of Alfred.

Alfred came to the throne after his three brothers, and
you all know how good and famous a king he was. It is

which Gregory made on the occasion ; tney are so atrociously bad that
they oould not be introduced into the columns of Punch,

said that his father indulged him, and that he did not know
how to read until he was twelve years old — but this, my
dears, I cannot believe ; or, at least, I cannot but regret that
there were no nice day schools then where children might
be taught to read before they were twelve, or ten, or even
eight years old, as many of my dear scholars can.

[Miss TiCKLETOBY here paused for a moment, and re-
sumed her lecture with rather a trem^ulous voice.

It is my wish to amuse this company as well as I can,
and sometimes, therefore — for I am by nature a facetious
old woman, heartily loving a bit of fun — I can't help mak-
ing jokes about subjects which other historians treat in a
solemn and pompous way.

But, dears, I don't think it right to make one single joke
about good King Alfred ; who was so good, and so wise, and
so gentle, and so brave, that one can't laugh, but only
love and honor his memory. Think of this, how rare
good kings are, and let us value a good one when he comes.
We have had just fifty kings since his time, who have
reigned for near a thousand long years, and he the only
Great one. Brave and victorious many of them have been,
grand and sumptuous, and a hundred times more powerful
than he : but who cares for one of them (except Harry the
Fifth, and I think Shakspeare made that king) — who loves
any of them except him — the man who spoiled the cakes
in the herdsman's cottage, the man who sang and played in
the Danes' camp ?

There are none of you so young but know those stories
about him. Look, when the people love a man, how grate-
ful they are ! For a thousand years these little tales have
passed from father to son all through England, and every
single man out of millions and millions who has heard them
has loved King Alfred in his heart, and blessed him, and
was proud that he was an Englishman's king. And then
he hears that Alfred fought the Danes, and drove them out
of England, and that he was merciful to his enemies, and
kept faith at a time when every one else was deceitful and
cruel, and that he was the first to make laws, and establish
peace and liberty among us.

Who cares for Charles the Second, secured in his oak,
more than for any other man at a pinch of danger ? Charles
might have stayed in his tree for us, or for any good that
he did when he came down. But for King Alfred, waiting
in his little secret island, until he should be strong enough



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES. 19

to have one more battle with his conquerors, or in the camp
of the enemy singing his songs to his harp, who does not
feel as for a dear friend or father in danger, and cry hurra !
with all his heart, when he wins ?

All the little Children, Hurray ! Alfred for ever !

Yes, my dears, you love him all, and would all fight for
him, I know.

Master Spry. That I would.

I'm sure you would, John, and may you never fight for a
worse cause ! Ah, it's a fine thing to think of the people
loving a man for a thousand years ! We sha'n't come to such
another in the course of all these lectures — except mayhap
if we get so far, to one George —

Mr. Mortimer (aloud, and with much confidence), George
the Fourth, you mean, miss, the first gentleman in Europe.

Miss T. (sternly). No, sir ; I mean George Washing-
ton, — the American Alfred, sir, who gave and took from
us many a good beating, and drove the English-'DdJie^ out
of his country.

Mr, Mortimer. Disgusting raddicle ! — Delancey, my
dear, come with me. Mem ! I shall withdraw my son from
your academy.

{^Exeunt Mortimer, Senior and Junior.

Miss T. Let them go. As long as honest people agree
with me, what care I what great men's flunkeys choose to
think ? Miss Budge, make out Mr. Mortimer's account.
Ladies and Gentlemen, on Wednesday next I hope for the
honor of resuming these lectures.

Mr. Simcoe, whose remuneration will be found at the oflB.ce,
that for the future he may spare his own remarks, philoso-
phical, laudatory, or otherwise, and confine himself simply

THE 8EA.-EING8 IK ENOLAKD.

N the olden time our glori-
ous country of England,
my dears, must have been
1 pleasant place ; for see
what numbers of people
hive taken a fancy to it !
First came the Romans,
as we have seen, then the
Saxons, — and when they
were comfortably estab-
li&hed here, the Danes,
under their S e a-k i n g s,
came gallantly over the
mam, and were not a
whit less charmed with
the island than fhe Saxons and Romans had been.

Amongst these distinguished foreigners may be men-
tioned the Sea^king Swayn who rame to England in the
year nine hundred and something, landing at Margate, with
which he was so pleased as to determine to stop there al-
together, — being, as he said, so much attached to this
country that nothing would induce him to go back to his
own. Wasn't it a compliment to us ? There is a great
deal of this gallantly in the people of the North ; and you
may have oteerved, even in our own days, that some of
them, 'specially Scotchmen, when once landed here, are
mighty unwilling to go home £^ain.

Well, King Swayn's stay became preposterously long ;
and his people consumed such a power of drink and victiuds
that at length our late beloved monarch, King Ethelred
the Second, was induced to send to him. A bard of those
days has recorded, with considerable minuteness, the par-
ticulars of Swayn's arrival ; and as his work has not been
noticed by Turner, Hallam, Hume, or any other English



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES. 2l

historian, it may be quoted with advantage here. Snoro
the bard (so called from the exciting effect which his poem
produced on his audience) thus picturesquely introduces ua
to the two Kings : —

" Let him come," said the King (in his mouth | buttered toast popping),

** At Wapping or at RedrifF | this boat-swain will be stopping.

" Take care,'* says Chancellor Wigfrid, | " he don't give you a wapping."

" I'm certain," says wise Wijrfrid, | " the Sea-king means us evilly ;
Herald, go to Margate | and speak unto him civilly;
And if he's not at Margate, | why then try Rarosgate and Tivoli."

The ballad, which is important to the archaeologian, as
showing how many of the usages of the present day pre-
vailed nine hundred years back (thus fondly do Englishmen
adhere to their customs !), and which shows that some of the
jokes called puns at present currently uttered as novelties
were in existence at this early period of time, goes on to
describe, with a minuteness that amounts almost to tedious-
ness, the interview between Swayn and the herald; it is
angry, for the latter conveys to the Danish monarch the
strongest exhortations, on the part of King Ethelred, to
quit the kingdom.

"Nay, I cannot go," said Swayn, | "for my ships are leaking."
" You shall have a fleet," says the herald, | " if that be what you're seek-
ing."
" Well, 1 won*t go, and that's flat," | answered Swayn the Sea-king.

Falling into a fury, Swayn then abuses the King of Eng-
land in the most contumelious terms; says that he will
make his back into a foot-ball, and employ his nose for a
bell-rope; but finally recollecting himself, dismisses the
herald with a present of five-eighths of a groat — twopence-
halfpenny (a handsome largesse, considering the value of
money in those days), bidding him at the same time order
what he liked to drink at the hotel where he (King Swayn)
resided. "Well,'' says the Chronicler pathetically, "well
might he order what he thought proper. Kinff Swayn of
Denmark never paid a cojpjperr A frightful picture of the
insolence and rapacity of the invader and his crew !

A battle, as is natural, ensues ; the invader is victorious —
Ethelred flies to France, and the venerable Chancellor Wig-
frid is put to the most dreadful tortures, being made by the
ferocious despot to undergo the indignities which (as we
have seen in the former passage) he had promised to inflict
on the Royal fugitive, as well as many more. As a speci-
men of the barbarian's ingenuity, it may be stated that the
martyr Wigfrid is made to administer a mockery of justice,
seated on a woolsack stuffed with — the mind revolts at the
thought — stuffed with fleas !

But it is remarkable that the bard Snoro, who so long as
Swayn was not victorious over Ethelred is liberal in his
abuse of the Dane, immediately on Ethelred's defeat changes
his note, and praises with all his might the new sovereign.
At Swayn's death he is lost in grief — being, however, con-
soled in the next stanza by the succession of his son Canute
to the throne.

Snoro gives particular accounts of Canute's reign and ac-
tions — his victories in foreign lands and the great drawn
battle between him and Edmund Ironsides, about whose
claims the bard is evidently puzzled to speak ; however, on
Edmund's death, which took place, singularly and conven-
iently enough, about a month after Canute and he had made
a compromise regarding the crown (the compromise left the
kingdom to the survivor) ^ Snoro takes up the strain loudly
and decidedly in favor of Canute, and hints at the same
time his perfect conviction that Ironsides is roasting in a
certain place.



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES, 28

And then, after following King Canute through his bat-
tles — in one of which the celebrated Godwin (who, I be-
lieve, afterwards married Mary Wollstonecraft) showed the
valor of Englishmen — after going through a list of mur-
ders, treasons, usurpations, which the great monarch com-
mitted, the bard comes to that famous passage in his history,
which all little boys know ; and I have the pleasure to show
a copy of an Anglo-Saxon drawing which is to be found in
the MS., and which never has been seen until the present
day.

[This drawing was handed round to the company by Miss
Tickletoby, and excited an immense sensation, which hav-
ing subsided, the lecturer proceeded to read from the same
MS., Claud. XXVII., XXVIII., " The Song of King Ca-
nute." *]

Kiner Canute was weary-hearted, | he had reigned for years a score ;
Battling, struggling, pushing, fighting, I killing much, and robbing more ;
And he thought upon his actions | walking by the wild sea-shore.

'Twixt the Chancellor and Bishop | walk'd the King with step sedate ;
Chamberlains and Grooms came after, | Silver-sticks and Grold-sticks great;
Chaplains, Aides-de-Camp, and Pages, | all the officers of State.

Sliding after like his shadow, | pausing when he chose to pause,

If a frown his face contracted | straight the courtiers dropp'd their jaws ;

If to laughter he was minded | out they burst in loud hee-haws.

But that day a something vex'd him, | that was clear to old and young ;
Thrice his Grace had yawn'd at table | when his favorite gleeman sung —
Once the Queen would have consoled him | and he bid her hold her tongue.

" Something ails my Royal master,*' | cried the Keeper of the Seal;
" Sure, my Lord, it is the lampreys | served at dinner, or the veal.
Shall I call your Grace's doctor ? " j " Psha ! it is not that I feel.

** 'Tis the heart and not the stomach, | fool ! that doth my rest impair ;
Can a king be great as I am, | prithee, and yet know no care ?
ph ! Vm sick and tired, and weary." | Some one cried, " The King's arm-
chair ! "

Then towards the lacqueys turning, | quick my Lord the Keeper nodded ;
Straight the King's great chair was brought him | by two K)Otmen able-
bodied ;
Languidly he sunk into it, | it was comfortably wadded.

* The poems are translated, word for word, from the Anglo-Saxon, by
the accomplished Adolphus Simcoe, Esquire, author of Perdition, The
Ghoul, editor of the Lady^s Lute, &c.

" Leading on my fierce companions/' I cried he, ** over storm and brine,
I have fought and I have conquered : ( where is glory like to mine ? *'
Loadly all the couitiers echoed, | " Where is glory uke to thine ? ''

'' What avail me all my kingdoms ? | I am weary now and old ;
Those fair sons I have begotten I long to see me dead and cold ;
Would I were, and quiet buried ] underneath the silent mould.

" Oh. remorse ! the wiithing serpent, | at my bosom tears and bites ;
Horrid, horrid things I look on [ though I put out all the lights, —
Ghosts of ghastly recollections | troop about my bed of nights.

Mothers weeping, virgins screammg | vainly to their slaughtered sires." —

LECTURE IV.




EDWARD THE CONFESSOR — HAROLD — WILLIAM THE

CONQUEROR.

ING CANUTE, whose adventures at the
watering-place my young friend Mr. Sim-
coe described last week in such exquisite
verse (and I am afraid that the doings at
watering-places are not often so moral),
died soon after, having repented greatly
of his sins. It must have been Graves-
end, I think, where the King grew so
thoughtful.

\_Here Miss T. was rather disappointed
that nobody laughed at her pun ; the fact is, that Miss
Budge, the usher, had been ordered to do so, but, as
usual, missed her point.
Before he died, he made a queer sort of reparation for all
the sins, robberies, and murders that he committed — he put
his crown on the head of the statue of a saint in Canterbury,
and endowed no end of monasteries. And a great satisfac-
tion it must have been to the relatives of the murdered peo-
ple to see the King's crown on the Saint's head ; and a great
consolation to those who had been robbed, to find the King
paid over all their money to the monks.

Some descendants of his succeeded him, about whom there
is nothing particular to say, nor about King Edward the
Confessor, of the Saxon race, who succeeded to the throne
when the Danish family failed, and who was canonized by
a Pope two hundred years after his death — his Holiness
only knows why.

Spooney, my dears, is a strong term, and one which, by a
sensitive female, ought to be employed only occasionally ;
but Spooney, I emphatically repeat [immense sensation"], is
the only word to characterize this last of the regular Saxon
kings. He spent his time at church, and let his kingdom
go to rack and ruin. He had a pretty wife, whom he never



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES. 27

had the spirit to go near; and he died, leaving his kingdom
to be taken by any one who could get it.

A strong, gallant young fellow, Harold by name, stepped
forward, and put the crown on his head, and vowed to wear
it like a man. Harold was the son of Earl Godwin that we
spoke of in the last lecture, a great, resolute fellow, who had
been fighting King Edward's enemies while the King was
singing psalms, and praying the saints to get rid of them,
and turned out with a sword in his hand, and a coat of mail
on his body, whilst the silly King stayed at home in a hair-
shirt, scourging and mortifying his useless old body.

Harold then took the crown (though, to be sure, he had
no right to it, for there was a nephew of the late King, who
ought to have been first served), but he was not. allowed to
keep undisturbed possession of it very long, for the fact is,
somebody else wanted it.

You all know who this was — no other than William,
Duke of Normandy, a great and gallant prince (though I
must say his mother was no better than she should be *),
who had long had a wish to possess the noble realm of Eng-
land, as soon as the silly old Confessor was no more. In-
deed, when Harold was abroad, William had told him as
much, making him swear to help him in the undertaking.
Harold swore, as how could he help it, for William told him
he would have his head off if he didn't ; and then broke his
oath on the first opportunity.

Some nine months, then, after Harold had assumed the
crown, and just as he had come from killing one of his
brothers (they were pretty quarrelsome families, my dears,
in those days), who had come to England on a robbing ex-
cursion, Harold was informed that the Duke of Normandy
had landed with a numerous army of horse, foot, and marines,
and proposed, as usual, to stay.

Down he went as fast as the coach could carry him (for
the Kentish railroad was not then open), and found Duke
WiUiam at Hastings, where both parties prepared for a
fight.

You, my darlings, know the upshot of the battle very
well ; and though I'm a delicate and sensitive female, and
though the Battle of Hastings occurred — let me see, take
1066 from 1842 — exactly seven hundred and seventy-six

years ago, yet I can't help feeling angry to think that those
beggarly, murderous Frenchmen shoidd have beaten our hon-
est English as they did. [CWes of ^^ Never mind, we^ve
given it ^em since.'^'j Yes, my dears, I like that spirit — we
have given it ^em since, as the Duke of Wellington at Bada-
jos, and my late lamented br-r-other. Ensign Samuel T-t-tic-
Idetoby, at B-b-bunhiU Row, can testify. [TAe Lecturer's
voice was here choked with emotion^ owing to the early death
of the latter lamented hero,"] But don't let us be too eager
for military glory, my friends. Look! we are angry be-
cause the French beat us eight hundred years ago ! And
do you suppose they are not angry because we beat them
some five-and-twenty years back ? Alas ! and alas ! this is
always the way with that fighting ; you can't satisfy both
parties with it, and I do heartily hope that one day there'll
be no such thing as a soldier left in all Europe. \_A voice,
^^And no police neither "'\

Harold being dead, his Majesty King William — of
whom, as he now became our legitimate sovereign, it be-
hoves every loyal heart to speak with respect — took pos-
session of England, and, as is natural, gave all the good
places at his disposal to his party. He turned out the Eng-
lish noblemen from their castles, and put his Norman
soldiers and knights into them. He and his people had it
all their own way ; and though the English frequently re-
belled, yet the King managed to quell all such disturbances,
and reigned over us for one-and-twenty years. He was a
gallant soldier, truly — stern, wise, and prudent, as far as
his own interests were concerned, and looked up to by all
other Majesties as an illustrious monarch.

But great as he was in public, he was rather uncomfortable
in his family, on account of a set of unruly sons whom he had
— for their Royal Highnesses were always quarrelling to-
gether. It is related that one day being at tea with her
Majesty the Queen, and the young princes, at one of his
castles in Normandy (for he used this country to rob it
chiefly, and not to live in it), a quarrel ensued, which was
certainly very disgraceful. Fancy, my darlings, three
young princes sitting at tea with their papa and mamma,
and being so rude as to begin throwing water at one an-
other! The two younger, H. R. H. Prince William and
H. R. H. Prince Henry, actually flung the slop-basin, or
some such thing, into the face of H. R. H. Prince Robert,
the King's eldest son.



MISS TICKLETOBrS LECTURES. 29

His Royal Highness was in a furious rage, although his
brothers declared that they were only in play; but he
swore that they had insulted him; that his papa and
mamma favored them and not him, aAd drawing 4 sword,
vowed that he would have their lives. His Majesty with
some difficulty got the young princes out of the way, but
nothing would appease Eobert, who left the castle vowing
vengeance. Tlus passionate and self-willed young man
was called Courthose, which means in French short inex-
pressibles, and he was said to have worn shorts, because his
lim^s were of that kind.

Prince Shorts fled to a castle belonging to the King of
France, who was quite jealous of Diie Robert, and was
anxious to set his family by the ears ; and the young prince
began forthwith robbing his father's dominions, on which
that monarch marched with an army to besiege him in his
castle.

Here an incident befell, which while it shows that Prince
Robert (for all the shortness of his legs) had a kind and
brave heart, will at the same time point out to my beloved
pupils the dangers — the awful dangers — of disobedience.
Prince Robert and his knights sallied out one day against
the besiegers, and engaged the horsemen of their party.
Seeing a warrior on the other side doing a great deal of ex-
ecution. Prince Robert galloped at him, sword in hand, and
engaged him. Their visors were down, and they banged
away at each other, like — like goodruns, [^JETear, hear J]

At last Prince Robert hit the other such a blow that he
felled him from his horse, and the big man tumbling off
cried " Oh, murder ! " or " Oh, I'm done for ! " or something
of the sort.

Fancy the consternation of Prince Robert when he recog-
nized the voice of his own father ! He flung himself off his
saddle as quick as his little legs would let him, ran to his
father, knelt down before him, besought him to forgive
him, and begged him to take his horse and ride home.
The King took the horse, but I am sorry to say he only
abused his son, and rode home as sulky as possible.

However, he came soon to be in a good-humor, acknow-
ledged that his son Prince Shortlegs was an honest fellow,
and forgave him, and they fought some battles together,
not against each other, but riding bravely side by side.

TJST before the breath ■was out
of the Conqueror's body, Wil-
liam Rufus, his second son
(who had much longer legs
than his honest elder brother
Robert), ran over to England,
took possession of some castles
and his father's money, and,
so fortified, had himself pro-
claimed King of England with-
out any difficulty. Honest
Robert remained Duke of Nor-
mandy ; and as for the third
son, Prince Henry, though not
30 handsomely provided for as his elder brothers, it appears
he man^^ed to make both ends meet by robbing on his own
account.

William's conduct on getting hold of the crown was so
violent, that some of the nobles whom he plundered were
struck with remorse at having acknowledged him King in-
stead of honest Courthose, his elder broiler. So they set
up a sort of rebellion, which Rufus quelled pretty easily,
appealing to the people to support him, and promising them
all sorts of good treatment in return. The people believed
hiai, fought for him, and when they had done what he
wanted, namely, quelled the rebellion, and aided him in
seizing hold of several of Robert's Korman castles and
towns — would you believe it ? — William treated them not
one bit better than before. [ Cries of " Shame ! " At these
exclamations Miss Tickletoby looked round very sternly.']
Young people, young people (exclaimed she), I'm aston-
ished at you. Don't you know that such cries on youc

Shame, indeed! Shame on you, for daring to insult our
late excellent Whig Ministry, our present admirable Con-
servative Cabinet, Sir Eobert, Lord John, and all, every
minister that ever governed us. They all promise to better
us, they all never do so. Learn respect for your betters,
young people, and do not break out into such premature re-
bellion. \^The children being silent. Miss T. put on a less
severe countenance and continued^ —

I will tell you a pleasant joke of that wag, his late Ma-
jesty King William Rufus. He put the kingdom into a
great fury against the Normans, saying, I have no doubt,
that they were our natural enemies, and called a huge army
together, with which, he said, he would go and annihilate
them. The army was obliged to assemble, for by the laws
of the country each nobleman, knight, thane, and landholder
was bound according to the value of his land to furnish so
many soldiers, knowing that the King would come down on
their estates else ; and so being all come together, and ready
to cross the water, the King made them a speech.

" Friends, Countrymen, and Fellow Soldiers (said he) ;
companions of my toil, my feelings, and my fame ; the eyes
of Europe are upon you. You are about to embark on a
most dangerous enterprise; you will have to undergo the
horrors of a sea voyage, of which I need not describe to you
the discomforts (the army began to look very blue). You
will be landed in a hostile country, which has been laid
waste by me already in my first invasions, as also by the
accursed policy of the despot who governs it. [Cries of
'^Doum with Eobert ShorthoseP^ '^No tyranny f "iVb

part of you will inevitably starve ; a considerable number
will be cut to pieces by the ferocious Norman soldiery ; and
even if it please Heaven to crown my just cause with suc-
cess, what will my triumph benefit you, my friends ? You
will be none the better for it ; but will come back many of
you without your arms and legs, and not a penny richer
than when you went. [^Immense sensation,']

" Now, I appeal to you as men, as Englishmen, as fathers
of families, will it not be better to make a peaceful and hon-
orable compromise than to enter upon any such campaign ?
Yes ! I knew you would say yes, as becomes men of sense,
men of honor — Englishmen, in a word, [-ffear, hear."] I
ask you, then — your sovereign and father asks you — will

it not be better to pay me ten shillings apiece all round, and
go home to your happy families — to your lovely wives, who
will thus run no risk of losing the partners of their beds —
to smiling children, who may still for many, many years
have their fathers to bless, maintain, and educate them?
Officers, carry the hats round, and take the sense of the
army."

Putting his handkerchief to his eyes, the beneficent mon-
arch here sat down : and what was the consequence of his
affecting appeal ? The hats were sent round — the whole
army saw the propriety of subscribing — fifteen thousand
pounds were paid down on the spot — a bloody war was
avoided — and thus, as the King said, all parties were bene-
fited.

For all this, however, it was not long before he had them
out again, and took a great number of his towns .and castles
from his brother Robert. At last he got possession of his
whole dukedom ; for at this time all Europe was seized with
a strange fit of frenzy and hatred against the Turks ; one
Peter, a hermit, went abroad preaching hatred against these
unbelievers, and the necessity of taking Palestine from
them, and murdering every mother's son of them. No less
than a million of men set off on this errand. Three hun-
dred thousand of them marched ahead, without food or fore-
thought, expecting that Heaven would provide them with
nourishment on their march, and give them the victory over
the Saracens. But this pious body was cut to pieces ; and
as for the doings of the other seven hundred thousand, what
heroes commanded them, what dangers they overcame, what
enchanters they destroyed, how they took the Holy City,
and what came of their conquest — all this may be read in
the veracious history of one Tasso, but has nothing to do
with the history of WiUiam Rufus.

That shrewd monarch would not allow his islanders to
meddle with the business ; but his brother, honest Robert,
quite sick of fighting, drinking, and governing in his own
country, longed to go to Palestine, and having no money (as
usual), William gave him a sum for which the other handed
over his inheritance to him ; and so Robert was got rid of,
and William became King of England and Duke of Nor-
mandy.

But he did not keep his kingdoms long. There is a tract
of land called the New Forest, in Hampshire, which has
been called so ever since the Conqueror's time. Once it

was a thriving district, covered with farms and villages and
churches, with many people living in it. But conquering
King William had a fancy to have a hunting-ground there.
Churches and villages he burnt down ; orcharda and corn-
fields he laid waste ; men, women, and children he drove
pitilessly away, and gave up the land to boar and deer. So
the people starved and died, and he had his hunting-ground.
And such a keen sportsman was he, and so tender and hu-
mane towards the dumb animals, that he gave orders, if any
man killed a boar, a deer, or even a haie, he should be killeef.

enjoyed many of the blessings of that noble code of laws.

His Majesty King William Eufus loved sport as well as
his royal father, and this New Forest above alL There
were all sorts of legends concerning it. The people said
(but this was, no doubt, from their superstitious hatred of
his Majesty's person and race), that, on account of the crimes
the Conqueror had committed in the spot, it was destined
to be fatal to his family. One of Eufus's brothers and his
nephew were actually killed while hunting there ; and one
morning in the year 1100, when his Majesty was going out
hunting, a monk came and prophesied death to him, and
warned him to stay at home.

But the scent was lying well on the ground ; the King

ordered the prophet a purse of money, and rode off with his
dogs.

He was found dead in the wood, with an arrow in his
breast ; and nobody knows who shot it : and what's more, my
loves, I fear nobody cares. A Frenchman by the name of
Tyrrell was supposed to have done the deed ; but Tyrrell
denied the charge altogether. His Royal Highness Prince
Henry was hunting with the King when the accident took
place, and as poor Robert Shorthose was away fighting the
Turks, Prince Henry slipped into his brother's shoes, and
ruled over the land of England.

Talking about shoes, a dreadful religious disturbance oc-
curred in England a propos de bottes. It was the fashion to
wear these with immense long toes ; and the priests, who
could pardon all sorts of crimes, wouldn't pardon the long-
toed boots. You laugh ? It is a fact, upon my word ; and
what is more, these popes and priests, who could set up
kings and pull them down, and send off millions of people
to fight in crusades, never were strong enough to overcome
the long-toed boots. The Fashion was stronger than the
Pope ; and long toes continued to flourish in spite of his
curses, and never yielded a single inch until — until Square-
toes came in.

HENBY I. — MAUDE — STEPHEN — HENRY II.

T TC 7E have still a little more to hear of honest Robert
VV Shorthose. With his usual luck, the poor fellow
came posting back from Jerusalem, a montn after his
brother Henry had taken possession of the English crown ;
and though at first he made a great noise, and got an army
together, with which, as he was a valiant captain, he might
have done his brother some hurt, yet the latter purchased
him off with some money, of which Shorthose was always
in want, and the two came to a compromise, it being agreed
that Robert should keep Normandy, and Henry England,
and that the survivor should have both.

So Shorthose went home with the money his brother gave
him, and lived and made merry as long as it lasted ; and the
historians say that he was such a spendthrift of a fellow,
and kept such a Castle Rackrent of a house, that he was
compelled to lie in bed several days for want of a pair of
breeches. [Much laughter at the imperturbed way in which
Miss TiCKLETOBY pronounccd the fatal word " breeches,''

But Henry, for all the agreement, would not let his brother
keep possession of that fine Dukedom of Normandy. He
picked continual quarrels with him, and ended by taking
possession of the Duchy, and of Shortlegs, in spite of his
bravery, whom he shut up in a castle, where he lived for
near five-and-twenty years after. His fate inspires one with
some regret, for he was a frank, open fellow, and had once,
in a siege, saved from starvation this very brother who
robbed him; but he was a fool, and did not know how to
keep what he had, and Henry was wise ; so it was better
for all parties that poor Shortlegs should go to the wall.
Peace be with him I We shall hear no more of him ; but it
is something in the midst of all these lying, swindling tyrants
and knaves, to find a man who, dissolute and brutal as he
waa, was yet an honest fellow.

King Henry, the first of his name, was, from his scholar-
ship (which, I take it, was no great things ; and am sure
that many a young lady in this seminary knows more than
ever he did), surnamed Beauclerc — a sharp, shifty fellow,
steering clear amidst all the glooms and troubles of his times,
and somehow always arriving at his end. He was admired
by all Europe for his wisdom. He had two fair kingdoms
which had once been riotous and disorderly, but which he
made quiet and profitable ; and that there might be no
doubts about the succession to the throne, he caused his
son. Prince William, to be crowned co-king with him, and
thus put the matter beyond a doubt.

There was, however, one obstacle, and this was the death
of Prince William. He was drowned, and his father never
smiled after. And after all his fighting and shuffling, and
swindling and cleverness and care, he had to die and leave
his throne to be fought for between his daughter and his
nephew, one Stephen ; of the particulars of whose reign it
need only be said, that they fought for the crown, like the
Devil and the baker, and sometimes one had it and some-
times the other. At last Stephen died, and Maude's son,
Henry II., came to reign over us in the year 1154.

He was a great prince, wise, brave, and tender-hearted ;
and he would have done much for his country, too, which
was attached to him, if the clergy and the ladies had left
him a moment's peace.

For a delicate female — [a hlush covered Miss T.'s counte-
nance with roses as she spoke'] — the subject which I am
now caUed upon to treat is — ahem ! — somewhat danger-
ous. The fact is, the King had married in very early life a
lady possessing a vast deal of money, but an indifferent rep-
utation, and who, having been wicked when young, became
very jealous being old, as I am given to understand is not
unfrequently the case with my interesting sex.

Queen Eleanor bore four sons to her husband, who was
dotingly fond of them all, and did not, I have reason to sup-
pose, bestow upon them that correction [a great sensation
in the school] which is necessary for all young people, to
prevent their becoming self-willed and licentious in man-
hood. Such, I am sorry to say, were all the young princes.
The elder, whom, to prevent mistakes, his father had crowned
during his lifetime, no sooner was crowned, than he modestly
proposed to his father to give up his kingdom to him, and
when he refused, rebelled, and fled to the King of France



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES. 89

for protection. All his brothers rebelled, too ; — there was
no end to the trouble and perplexity which the unhappy
King had to suffer.

I have said that the Queen was jealous, and, oh! I am
ashamed to confess, when speaking of his late Sacred Ma-
jesty, a King of England, that the Queen, in this instance,
had ^ood cause. A worthless, wicked, naughty, abandoned,
profligate, vile, improper, good-for-nothing creature, whom
historians, forsooth, have handed down to us under the name
of Fair Kosamund — (Fair Rosamund, indeed ! a pretty pass
things are come to, when hussies like this are to be bepraised
and bepitied !) — I say, a most wicked, horrid, and aban-
doned person, by name Miss Rosamund Clifford, had weaned
the King's affections from his lady. Queen Eleanor.

Suppose she was old and contumacious : * do not people
marry " for better, for worse '^ ? Suppose she had a bad
temper, and a worse character, when the King married her
Majesty : did not he know what sort of a wife he was tak-
ing ? — A pretty pass would the world come to, if men were
allowed to give up their wives because they were ill-tem-
pered, or go hankering after other people's ladies because
their own were a little plain, or so !

[/mmeiwe applause from the ladies present. And it was
here remarked — though we do not believe a word of
the story — that Mrs. Binks looked particularly hard
at Mr. BiNKS, saying, " B., do you hear that ? " and
BiNKS, on his part, looked particularly foolish.
How this intimacy with this disreputable Miss Clifford
commenced, or how long it endured, is of little matter to
us : but, my friends, it is quite clear to you, that such a con-
nection could not long escape the vigilance of a watchful
and affectionate wife. 'Tis true, Henry took this person to
Woodstock, where he shut her up in a castle or labyrinth :
but he went to see her often — and, I appeal to any lady
here, could her husband, could any man, make continual vis-
its to Woodstock, which is five and forty miles from Lon-
don, without exciting suspicion ? [iVb, no /]

After this, for his whole life long, Henry never had a

or all of them together, with the King of France at their
back. He was almost always victorious ; but he was of a
forgiving temper, and the young men began and rebelled as
soon as he had set them free. In the midst of one of these
attacks by one of the Princes, an attack was made upon the
young man of a sort which neither young nor old can parry.
He was seized with a fever, and died. He besought his
father's forgiveness when dying, but his death does not ap-
pear to have altered his brothers' ways, and at last, of a
sheer broken heart at their perverseness, it seems that
Henry himself died : nor would he forgive his sons their
shameful conduct to him.

And whom had he to thank for all his disobedience ?
Himself and Fair Rosamund. Yes, I repeat it, if he had
not been smitten with her, the Queen would not have been
jealous ; if she had not been jealous, she would not have
quarrelled with him ; if she had not quarrelled with him,
she would not have induced her sons to resist him, and he
might have led an easy and comfortable life, and have
bettered thus the kingdoms he governed.

Take care, then, my dear young friends, if you are called
upon to govern kingdoms, or simply, as is more probable, to
go into genteel businesses and keep thriving shops, take
care never to offend your wives. [^Hear, hear /] Think of
poor King Henry, and all the sorrows he brought upon him-
self ; — and in order not to offend your wives, the best
thing you can do is to be very gentle to them, and do with-
out exception every single thing they bid you.

At the end of this Lecture, several ladies present came
up, and shook Miss Tickletoby by the hand, saying they
never heard better doctrine. But the gentlemen, it must be
confessed, made very light of the excellent lady's opinions.

and one of tliem said that, after her confession, even if
she were young and handsome, nobody would ask her to
marry.

" Nobody wants you, sir,^^ said Miss Tickletoby ; and she
was more than usually rigid in her treatment of that gen-
tleman's little boy the next day.

LECTURE VII.

RICHARD THE FIRST.

The danger of extolling too much the qualities of a warrior — In kings
they are more especially to be reprehended — Fiightful picture of war
— Its consequences to men — To women — Horrible danger that Miss
Tickletoby might have undergone — The Crusades — Jealousy of
Philip Augustus — Gallantry of Richard — Saladin, his character,
and the reverence entertained for him by the British monarch —
Ascalon — Jerusalem -- Richard's return from Palestine — His cap-
tivity — Romantic circumstances attending his ransom — His death
— A passing reflection.

THIS is a prince, my dear young creatures, whom I am
afraid some of you. Master Spry especially, will be
inclined to admire vastly, for he was as quarrelsome and
brave a man as ever lived. He was fighting all his life
long — fighting his brothers, fighting his father, fighting
with anybody who would fight, and, I have no doubt,
domineering over anybody who wouldn^t. When his poor
old father, wearied out by the quarrels of his sons, the in-
trigues of the priests, and the ceaseless cares and anxieties
of reigning, died in sadness and sorrow, he left Prince
Richard, surnamed Lion-Heart, his kingdom, and his curse
along with it, he having acted so undutifully towards him,
and embittered the last years of his life.

Richard was exceedingly sorry for the pain he had caused
his father, and, instead of revenging himself upon his
father's Ministers (who had treated him as severely as they
could during King Henry's reign, and who now, I dare say,
quaked in their shoes lest King Richard should deal hardly
by them), he of the lion-heart kept them in their places —
and good places, let us be sure, they were ; and said that
they had done their duty by his father, and would no doubt
be as faithful to him. For, truth to say, Richard had a
heart which harbored no malice ; all he wanted was plenty
of fighting, which he conducted in perfect good-humor.

Master Spry, Hurra ! that's your sort.

Silence, Master Spry, you silly boy, you. It may be very

well for Mr. Cribb, or the Most Noble the Marquess of
"Wat — ford, to rejoice in punching people's heads and break-
ing their noses, and to shake hands before and after ; but
kings have other duties to attend to, as we nowadays know
very well. Now suppose you were to break a score of lamps
in the street, or to twist off as many knockers, or to knock
down and injure a policeman or two, who would be called
on, as you have never a sixpence in your pocket, to pay the
damage ?

Master Spry, Pa'd pay, of course.

Yes, rather than see you on the treadmill, he would ; and
so, my dears, it's the case with these great kings — they
fight, but we have to pay. The poor subjects suffer ; the
men, who have no quarrel with any prince in Christendom

— as how should they, never having seen one ? — must pay
taxes in the first place, and then must go and fight, and be
shot at and die, leaving us poor women, their wives and
daughters, to deplore their loss, and to nurse their wounds
when they come home. Some forty years since (when I
was young, my loves, and reported to be extremely good-
looking), King Bonaparte and the French were on the
point of invading this country. Fancy what a situation we
should have been in had they come — the horrid monsters !
My mind shudders at the very idea even now. Fancy my
dear father, the ensign of volunteers, brought home wounded

— dying. Fancy a dozen of horrible soldiers billeted in the
house. Fancy some tall ferocious French general, with
great black whiskers — Bonaparte himself, very likely, or
Marshal Ney, at the very least — falling in love with a
beauteous young creature, and insisting upon her marrying
him ! My loves, I would have flung myself off London
Bridge first. \_Immense cheering, part of which, however,
seemed to he ironical.']

Such — such is war! and, for my part, I profess the
greatest abhorrence of all such dreadful kinds of glory ; and
hope for the days when cocked-hats and bayonets will only
be kept as curiosities in museums, and scarlet cloth wiU
be kept to make cloaks for old women.

But to return to King Eichard — though he professed to
be YQxy sorry for his turbulent conduct during his father's
reign, his sorrow did not lead him to mend his ways at
all ; as, alas ! is usual with all quarrelsome people. The
very first thing he did was to prepare for a great fight ;
and in order to get money for this, he not only taxed his



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES. 45

people very severely, but sold for a trifle the kingdom of
Scotland, which his father had won. I don't know what
the sum was which might be considered as trifling for the
purchase of that country,* and indeed historians differ
about it ; but I leave you to imagine how hardly he must
have been pressed for coin, when he could bring such an
article as that to pawn.

What was called the Christian world then was about this
time bent upon taking Jerusalem out of the hands of the
Turks, who possessed it, and banded together in immense
numbers for this purpose. Many of the princes so leagued
were as false, wicked, and tyrannous men as ever lived ;
but Richard Coeur-de-Lion had no artifice at all in his na-
ture, and entered into the undertaking, which he thought
a godly one, with all his heart and soul. To batter out
Turks' brains with his great axe seemed to him the height
of Christianity, and no man certainly performed this ques-
tionable duty better than he. He and the King of France
were the leaders of the crusade ; but the latter, being jeal-
ous, or prudent, or disgusted with the enterprise, went
speedily back to his kingdom, and left all the glory and all
the fighting to King Richard. There never was, they say,
such a strong and valiant soldier seen. In battle after
battle the Turks gave way before him, and especially at the
siege of Ascalon, he and his army slew no less than forty
thousand Saracens, and defeated consequently Sultan Sala-
din, their leader.

In the intervals of fighting it seems that a great number
of politenesses passed between these two princes ; for when
Richard was ill, Saladin sent him a box of pills from his
own particular druggist ; and as for Richard, it is said at
one time that he wanted to knight the gallant Saracen, as
though for all the world he were an Alderman or a Royal
Academician. And though the Lion-hearted King felt it
his Christian duty to pursue the Turk, and knock his brains
out if he could catch him, yet he would not deny that he
was a noble and generous prince, and admired him more than
any sovereign in his own camp. Wasn't it magnanimous ?
Oh, very !

* Miss Tickletoby's extreme prejudice against Scotland and the Scotch
may be accounted for bj the fact, that an opposition academy to hers is
kept by Mr. M*Whirter, who, report says, once paid his addresses to Miss
T. Having succeeded in drawing off a considerable nnmber of her pupils
to his SQhool, Mr. M' W. at once discontinued his suit.

At last, after a great uumber of victories, Eichard came in
sight of the City of Jei-usalem, which was strongly fortified
by the Turkish Sultan ; and there the Lion-hearted Kii^
hkd the misfortune to tiud that there was not a single chance
for him ever to win it. His ai'my, by the number of glori-
ous victories, was wasted away greatly. The other kings,
dukes, and potentates, his allies, grumbled sadly ; and the
end was, that he was obliged to march back to the sea
again — and you may fancy Sultan Saladin's looks as he
went off.




So he quitted the country in disguise, and in disgust too
— (as for his army, never mind what became of that : if we
lose our time pitying the common soldiers, we may cry till
we are as old as Methuselah, and not get on)^ — Eichard,!
say, quitted the country in disguise and disgust, and in
company with a faithful friend or two, made for home.

But as he was travelling through Austria, he was recog-
nized by some people in that country, and seized upon by



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES. 47

the Duke of Austria, who hated him, and clapped him with-
out any ceremony into prison. And, I dare say, while
there he heartily regretted that, instead of coming home
over land, he hadn^t at once taken the steamer to Malta,
and so got home that way.

Fancy then, my beloved hearers, this great but unhappy
monarch in prison. Fancy him, in a prison dress very
likely, made to take his turn on the mill with other offend-
ers, and to live on a pint of gruel and a penny loaf a day ;
he who had been accustomed to the best of victuals, and
was, if we may credit the late celebrated Sir Walter Scott,
particularly partial to wine ! There he was — a king — a
great warrior — but lately a leader of hundreds of thou-
sands of men, a captive in an odious penitentiary ! Where
was his army ? again one can't help thinking. Oh, never
mind them : they were done for long since, and out of their
pain. So you see it is King Richard who is the object of
compassion, for he wasnH killed.

I am led to believe that the prison regimen in Austria
was not so severe as it is nowadays with us, when if a pris-
oner were heard singing, or playing the fiddle, he would be
prettily tickled by the gaoler's cane ; for it appears that
King Richard had the command of a piano, and was in the
habit of playing upon the guitar. It is probable that the
Duke of Austria thought there could be no harm in his
amusing himself in the lonely place in which, unknown to
all the world. King Richard was shut.

As for his subjects, I don't know whether they missed
him very much. But I have remarked that we pretty
speedily get accustomed to the absence of our kings and
royal families ; and though, for instance, there is our be-
loved Duke of Cumberland gone away to be King of Hano-
ver, yet we manage to bear our separation from that august
prince with tolerable resignation.

Well, it was lucky for the King that he was allowed his
piano ; for it chanced that a poor wandering minstrel (or
organ-grinder, we should call him), who had no doubt been
in the habit of playing tunes before the King's palace
in Saint James's Street, — for, you know, the new police
wasn't yet invented, to drive him off — I say the organ-
grinder Blundell happened to be passing by this very cas-
tle in Austria where Richard was, and seeing a big house,
thought he might as well venture a tune ; so he began that
sweet one " Cherry ripe, che-erry ripe, ri-ip I cry-y ; " and



48 CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUNCH.

the Austrian soldiers, who were smoking their pipes, and
are very fond of music, exclaimed, "Potztausend, was ist
das fur ein herrliohes Lied ? "

When Richard heard that well-known melody, which in
happier days he had so often heard Madame Vestris sing,*
he replied at once on the piano with " Home, sweet Home."

" Hullo ! " says Blondell, or Blundell, "there must be an
Englishman here," and straightway struck up " Rule Britan-
nia " — " When Britain f eh-eh-eh-erst at He-evn's command,"
etc. — to which the King answered by "God save the
King."

"Can it be — is it possible — no — yes — is it really our
august monarch ? " thought the minstrel — and his fine
eyes filled with tears as he ground the sweet air, " Who are
you ? "

To which the King answered by a fantasia composed of
the two tunes " The King, God bless him," and " Dicky
Gossip, Dicky Gossip is the man " — for though his name
wasnH Gossip, yet you see he had no other way of explain-
ing himself.

Convinced by these melodies, Mr. Blundell replied rap-
idly by " Charlie is my Darling," " All's Well," " We only
part to meet again," and, in short, with every other tune
which might, as he thought, console the royal prisoner.
Then (only stopping to make a rapid collection at the gate)
he posted back to London as fast as his legs would carry
him, and told the Parliament there that he had discovered
the place where our adored monarch was confined.

Immense collections were instantly made throughout the
country — some subscribed of their own accord, others were
made to subscribe ; the Emperor of Germany, who was made
acquainted with the fact, now, though the Duke of Austria
had never said a word about it previously, caused the latter
prince to give up his prisoner ; and I believe his Imperial
Majesty took a good part of the ransom to himself.

Thus at last, after years of weary captivity, our gracious
King Richard was restored to us. Eancy how glad he must
have been to see Hyde Park once more, and how joyful and
happy his people were ! — I dare say he vowed never to
quit Buckingham Palace again, and to remain at home and
make his people happy.

But do you suppose men so easily change their natures ?
Fiddlestick ! — in about a month King Richai'd was fight-
ing in France as hard as ever, and at last was killed before
a small castle which he was besieging. He did not pass six
months in England in the whole course of his four years'
reign : he did more harm to the country than many a worse
king could do ; and yet he was loved by his people for his
gallantry ; and somehow, although I know it is wrong, I
can't help having a sneaking regard for him, too.

LECTUEE VIII.

AS it is by no means my wish to say anything disre-
spectful of any sovereign who ever ascended the
British throne, we must, my loves, pass over the reign of
his late Majesty King John as briefly as possible ; for,
between ourselves, a greater rascal never lived. You have
many of you read of his infamous conduct to Rowena,
Cedric the Saxon, and others, in the history of Sir Wilfrid
of Ivanhoe; and I fear there are other facts, though per-
haps not on so good authority, which are still more disrep-
utable.

In the plays of the ingenious Shakspeare, some of which
I have seen at Covent Garden, his Majesty's nephew,
Prince Arthur, is made to climb over a canvas wall of about
three feet high, and die lamentably of the fall in a ditch, in
which a mattress has been laid ; but the truth, I fear, is,
that Prince Arthur did not commit suicide voluntary or in-
voluntary, but that his Royal Uncle killed him, for his
Royal Highness was the son of his Majesty's elder brother,
and, by consequence, our rightful king. Well, well, there
are ugly stories about high personages at court, and you
know it makes very little difference to either of the princes,
now, which reigned and which didn't ; and I dare say, if
the truth were known. King John by this time is heartily
sorry for his conduct to his august nephew.

It may be expected that I should speak in this place of
a celebrated document signed in this reign, by some called
the commencement of our liberties, by others Magna Charta.
You may read this very paper or parchment at the
British Museum any day you please, and if you find any-
thing in it about our liberties, I am a Dutchman — that is,
a Dutchwoman [hear, hear] ; whereas, as the Register of
Saint Bartholomew's, Smithfield, of the year seventeen
hundred and — ahem ! — as the Register, I say, proves, I
am a Briton, and glory in the title.

The Pope of Rome who lived in those days was almost



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES. 61

as facetious a person as Pope Gregory, of whom before we
have spoken ; and what do you think he did ? I'm blessed
if he did not make a present of the kingdom of England to
the King of France ! \immense laughter], then afterwards
he made a present of it to King John very kindly ; and the
two kings were about, as usual, to fight for it, when the
French king's army was in part shipwrecked, and partly
beaten ; and King John himself was seized with an iUness,
which put an end to him. And so farewell to him. He re-
belled against his father, he conspired against his brother,
he murdered his nephew, and he tyrannized over his peo-
ple. Let us shed a tear for his memory, and pass on to his
son, King Henry III., who began to reign in the year 1216,
and was king for no less than fifty-six years.

I think the best thing he did during that long period was,
to beget his gallant son, who reigned after him, under the
title of King Edward the First. The English lords, in
King Henry's time, were discontented with his manner of
reigning — for he was always in the hands of one favorite
or another ; and the consequence was, that there were per-
petual quarrels between the lords and the prince, who was
continually turned out of his kingdom and brought back
again, or locked up in prison and let loose again. In the
intervals the barons ruled, setting up what is called an
oligarchy : when Henry governed himself, he was such a
soft effeminate creature, that I think they might have called
his reign a molly garchy,

(As not the least applause or laughter followed this pun.
Miss T., somewhat disconcerted, said) I see you do not wish
to hear anything more regarding Henry III., so, if you
please, we will pass on to the history of his son, a wise
king, a stern and great warrior. It was he who first gave
the Commons of England in Parliament any authority or
power to cope with the great barons, who had hitherto car-
ried all before them ; which, with the most sincere respect
for their lordships, I cannot but think was a change for the
better in our glorious Constitution.

He was in the Holy Land when his father's death was
announced to him, following the fashion of that day, to
fight against the Turks, and murder them for the honor of
religion. And here I cannot help pointing out how neces-
sary it is that men should never part from their wives ; for
the king, by having his with him, escaped a great danger.
A man of a certain tribe called the Assassins (who have



62 CONTRIBUriONS TO PUNCH.

given their oames to murderers ever since) stabbed the
kii^ in his tent with a, dagger, whereupon the queen, and
honor be to her, supposing that the knife which inflicted the




wound might have been poisoned, sucked the wound with
her own royal lips, and caused Prince Edward to say, that
a good wife was the very best doctor in the world. Look
how the great artist I employ has represented the scene !



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES, 58

This good queen died abroad, and her husband caused
crosses to be erected at the different places where her body
rested on its way to its burial, where the people might stop
and pray for her soul. I wonder how many people who
pass by Charing Cross nowadays ever think of her, or
whether the omnibuses stop there in order that the cads
and coachman may tell their beads for good Queen Elinor ?

From 1272, when he began to reign, until 1307, when he
died, King Edward was engaged in ceaseless wars. Being
•lord of the largest portion of the island of Great Britain,
he had a mind to possess the whole of it ; and, in order to
do so, had to subdue the Welsh first, and the Scots after-
wards. Perhaps some of you have read an ode by Mr.
Gray, beginning " Ruin seize thee, ruthless king " ? (But
as not a single person in the company had. Miss T. said)
At any rate, my loves, you have heard, no doubt, of the
bards ?

Miss Binge, Papa calls Shakspeare the immoral bard
of Heaven. What is a bard, ma'am ?

Miss T, Why, the bards, as I am led to believe, are
Welsh poets, with long beards, who played Welsh airs
upon Welsh harps. Some people are very fond of these
airs ; though, for my part, I confess, after hearing " Poor
Mary Ann'' played for fourteen consecutive hours by a
blind harper at Llangollen, I rather felt as if I should
prefer any other tune to that.

Master Spry, Pray, ma'am, hare the Welsh airs hany-
thing like the Welsh rabbits ? If so, mother can perform
'em very prettily. \_A laugh, which Miss Tickletoby se-
verely checks, and continues — ]

This country of Wales King Edward determined should
be his own, and accordingly made war upon the princes of
the Principality, who withstood him in many bloody ac-
tions, and at one time were actually puffed up with the
idea that one of their princes should become King of Eng-
land, on account of an old prophecy of Merlin's —

" Llwllwyn pdwdliocU cwmlwm.** — Merlin's Prophecies.

" Let Wales attend ! the bard prophetic said :
I. V. at Y. shall crown Llewellyn's Z." — Simcoe.

From which obscure phrase the people, and Llewellyn him-
seK, were led to believe that they would overcome the stern
and powerful King of England.

But the prophecy was fulfilled in a singular way. On

the two armies meeting together on the river Wye, Lle-
vellyiL was slain by an English knight, and his head in de-
tision crowned with ivy. The other Welsh sovereign,
Prince David, met with a worse fate than to die in battle :
he repeatedly rebelled a^nst King Edward, and was for^
given until the last time, when he was taken in arms, and
juiced to die as a rebel, so forming the last of his line.

If the king had had trouble with the Welsh, with the
Scots he' had still more, and was occupied during almost the
whole of his reign in settling (after his own fashion, to be
sure) that unruly nation.




In one of his invasions of Scotland, he carried off the
famous stone on which the Scottish kings used to sit at
their coronation — and a very cold seat it must have been
for their majesties, considering their unhappy custom of
wearing no small-clothes ; which are not the least of the in-
estimable, I may say inexpressible, benefits the Scots have
derived from commerce with this country.

The regular line of the Scotch kings having ended —
(never mind in whose person, for, after all, a king without
pantaloons is a sorry subject to trouble one's head about)
— the regular line being ended, there started up several
claimants to the throne ; the lords of the country, in an evil
hour, called upon Edward to decide who should succeed.



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES. 65

He gave a just award, assigning the crown to one John
Baliol ; but he caused Baliol to swear fealty to him for his
crown, and did not scruple about having him up to London
whenever he was minded. It is said that he summoned
him to Court six times in one year, when Edinburgh was at
least a month's journey from London. So thus the poor
fellow must have passed the whole year upon the road,
bumping up and down on a rough-trotting horse ; and he
without what-d'ye-call-'ems, too! — after the fashion of
Humphry Clinker.

The consequence may be imagined. Baliol was quite worn
out by such perpetual jolting. Flesh and blood couldn't
bear twelve of these journeys in a year ; and he wrote to
King Edward, stating his determination no longer to be
sadcfled with a throne.

Wisely, then, he retired. He took up his residence in
Normandy, where he passed his life quietly in devotion, it
is said, and the cultivation of literature. The Master of
Baliol College, Oxford, has kindly communicated to me a
MS., in the handwriting of the retired prince, accompanied
with designs, which, though rude, are interesting to the an-
tiquary. On the preceding page is one representing John
of Baliol on the North road, which must have been in a sad
condition indeed at the close of the thirteenth century.

The motto placed beneath the illumination by the royal
bard is a quaint, simple, and pathetic one. He says touch-
ingly —

" To Scotys withonten brychys rydinp:e is not swete.
I mote have kept my crowne, I shold have lost my seate."

He retired, then ; but a greater than he arose to battle
for the independence of his country.

LECTITKE IX.

EDWAKD I. THE SCOTS AND THEIB CLAIMS.

COTCHMEN, my dears, you know
are my antipathy, and I had at
one time thought^ in these lec-
tures, of so demolishing the rep-
utation of William Wallace, that
historians would neyer more hare
dared to speak about him, and
the numbers who heard me, the
millions who read me in Punch,
the countless myriads who in fu-
ture ages will refer to that work
when we, young and old, are no
more, would have seen at once
that the exploits ascribed to him
were fabulous for the most part,
and his character as doubtful as
his history.

Some late writers have been very hard upon him. Di,
Lingard, especially, has fallen foul of his claims to be a
hero ; and another author, Mr. Keightley, has been to the
full as severe, quoting sentences from the old chroniclers
strongly defamatory of Wallace's character. One of these
calls him " (juidam latro publicus," a certain common thief ;
another, writing of his family, says he was "ex infim&
gente procreatus " — sprung from the lowest of the low ;
but these writers, it must be remembered, were of the
English nation and way of thinking. Washington was sim-
ilarly abused during the American war ; and I make no
doubt that some of my darlings, who read the EngKsh
newspapers, have seen exactly the same epithets applied to
Mr. Daniel O'Connell.

It is easy to call names in this way, but let us, my be-
loved young friends, be more charitable ; in the case of
these Scots especially ; for if we take Wallace from them,
what hero do we leave to the poor creatures ? Sir Walter




MISS TICKLETOBrS LECTURES. 57

Scott has, to be sure, invented a few good Scotchmen in his
novels, and perhaps their actions, and those of Wallace, are
equally true.

But even supposing that he did come of a low stock —
that he was a freebooter once — it is clear that he came to
command the Scotch armies, that he was for a short time
Begent of the kingdom. So much the more creditable to
him then was it that, by his skill and valor, he overcame
those brave and disciplined troops that were sent against
him, and raised himself to the position he occupied for a
while over the heads of a powerful, ignorant, cowardly, sor-
did, treacherous, selfish nobility, such as that of the Scots
was.

Even poor John Baliol made one or two attempts to res-
cue his crown from the domineering Edward ; but these no-
bles, though they conspired against the English king, were
the first to truckle down to him when he came to assert
what he called his right ; and the proof of their time-serv-
ing conduct is, that King Edward forgave every one of
them, except Wallace, who was the only man who refused
to come to terms with the conqueror.

During the King's absence Wallace had tolerable success;
he discomfited the English leaders in many small skir-
mishes and surprises, and defeated, at Cambuskenneth, a
great body of the English troops. He thought, too, to have
as easy work with the king himself, when Edward, hearing
of his lieutenant's defeat, came thundering down to avenge
him. But the Scot was no match for the stem English
warrior. At Falkirk the king gave Wallace's army such a
beating as almost annihilated it, and Wallace was obliged
to fly to the woods, where he was finally seized by one of
his former friends and adherents ; and, being sent to Lon-
don, there died the death of a traitor.

Be warned, then, my little dears, when you come to read
the History of the Scottish Chiefs, by my dear friend Miss
Porter, that William Wallace was by no means the charac-
ter which that charming historian has depicted, going into
battle, as it were, with a tear in his eye, a cambric handker-
chief in his hand, and a flounce to his petticoat ; nor was he
the heroic creature of Tytler and Scott ; nor, most prober
bly, the ruffian that Doctor Lingard would have him to be.

He appears, it is true, to have been as violent and fero-
cious a soldier as ever lived ; in his inroads into England
murdering and ravaging without pity. But such was the



68 CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUNCH.

custom of his time ; and such being the custom, as we ex-
cuse Wallace for murdering the English, we must excuse
Edward for hanging Wallace when he caught him. Hang-
ing and murdering, look you, were quite common in those
days ; nay, they were thought to be just and laudable, and
I make no doubt that people at that period who objected to
such murders at all were accused of "sickly sentimental-
ity," just as they are now who presume to be hurt when
the law orders a fellow-creature to be killed before the Old
Bailey. Well, at any rate, allow us to be thankful that we
do not live in those days, when each of us would have had
a thousand more chances of being hanged than now. There
is no sickly sentimentality about such a preference as that.

Let us allow, then, the claims of Wallace to be a hero and
patriot. Another hero arose in Scotland after Wallace's
discomfiture, who was more lucky than he ; but stern King
Edward of the long shanks was dead when Bruce's triumphs
were secured ; and his son, Edward of Carnarvon, was mak-
ing-believe to reign.

This Bruce had been for a long time shilly-shallying as to
the side he should take ; whether he should join his coun-
trymen over whom he might possibly become king; or
whether be should remain faithful to King Edward, and not
risk his estates or his neck. The latter counsel for some
time prevailed ; for amongst other causes he had to take
sides against his country, a chief one was, hatred of the
Baliols. When John of Baliol died, his son being then a
prisoner in London, a nephew of John Baliol, called Comyn
of Badenoch, became the head man in Scotland. He had
always been found gallantly in arms against King Edward,
doing his duty as a soldier in Falkirk fight, and in many
other actions, with better or similar fortune — not sneaking
in the English camp as Bruce was.

The king, however, who had pardoned the young man
many times, at last got wind of some new conspiracies in
which he was engaged, and vowed, it was said, to make
away with him. Bruce got warning in time, made for
Scotland, called a meeting with the Eegent, Comyn of
Badenoch, who granted the interview, and hereupon Bruce
murdered Comyn in God's church, and at once proclaimed
himself King of Scotland. The Scotch historians have
tried to apologize as usual for this foul and dastardly assas-
sination, saying that it was done in a heat — unpremed-
itated, and so forth, Nonsense, my loves ; Robert Bruce



MISS TICKLETOBrS LECTURES, 59

had been shuffling and intriguing all his life. He mur-
dered the man who stood between him and the crown —
and he took it, and if you read Sir Walter Scott's " Lord of
the Isles," you will see what a hero he has made of him.
Oh, these Scotchmen ! these Scotchmen ! how they do stand
by one another !

Old Edward came tearing down to the borders on the
news, vowing he would kill and eat Robert Bruce ; but it
was not so ordained; the old King was carried off by a
much more powerful enemy than any barelegged Scot ; and
his son, Edward of Carnarvon (who reigned 1307-1327)
had not the energy of his father ; and though he made sev-
eral attempts to punish the Scots, was usually left in the
lurch by his nobility, and on one occasion, at Bannockburn,
cruelly beaten by them. They have made a pretty pother
about that battle, I warrant you, those Scots ; and you may
hear tailors from Glasgow or Paisley still crow and talk big
about it. Give the fellows their battle, my dears ; we can
afford it. [^Great sensation.^ As for the murderer, Robert
Bruce, he was, it must be confessed, a wary and gallant cap-
tain — wise in good fortune, resolute in bad, and he robbed
the English counties to the satisfaction of his subjects.
It is almost a pity to think he deserved to be hanged.

During the dissensions in England, Robert Bruce, having
pretty well secured Scotland, took a fancy to Ireland, too —
invaded the country himself, came rather suddenly back
again, and sent his brother Edward, who even had the im-
pudence to be crowned King of Ireland : but the English
forces coming up with him took his crown from him with
his head in it — and so ended the reigns of the Bruces in
Ireland.

As for Edward of Carnarvon, little good can be said of
him or his times. An extravagant idle king, insolent favor-
ites (though Gaveston, it must be confessed, was a gallant
and dashing fellow), bullying greedy barons, jealous that
any one should have power but themselves, and, above all
(alas ! that I should have to say it), an infamous disreputa-
ble wretch of a French wife, fill the whole pages of this
wretched king's reign with their quarrels, their vices, and
their murders. In the midst of their quarrels they allowed
the country to be bullied by the French, and even the Scots ;
the people were racked and torn by taxes and tyranny ; the
king was finally deposed, and murdered by the intrigues of
his wicked vixen of a wife, who did not, however, enjoy her

ill-gotten honors long as regent of the kingdom. Edward
the Third came to the throne, and of him we will speak in
the next Lecture.

In the year 1356, the Black Prince, who had commenced
his career ten years earlier as a gallant young soldier
at Cr^cy, had an opportunity of achieving for himself a
triumph to the full as great as that former famous one.
Robbing and murdering for ten years, as he had been, he
had become naturally a skilful captain ; and now, in 1356,
say the historians, having left his chief city of Bordeaux
with 12,000 men, crossing the Garonne, oveminning Querci,
the Limousin, Auvergne, and Berri, slaughtering the peas-
antry'', destroying the corn, wine, and provisions, and burn-
ing the farm-houses, villages, and towns, he was surprised
near Poictiers, in the province of Poitou, by a large army,
led by King John of France. The French army was very
large — that of the Black Prince very small. "Heaven
help us ! " said his Royal Highness ; " it only remains for
us to fight bravely."

He was, however, so doubtful as to the result of the action,
that he sent rather modest proposals to the French King,
offering to give up his plunder and prisoners, and to promise
not to serve against France for seven years, if the French
would but let him off this time. King John, however, re-
plied, that he must have the Black Prince and a hundred of
his chief knights as prisoners, before he would listen to any
terms of accommodation, which idea his Royal Highness
" indignantly rejected."

He beat the King of France, whose goods he was carry-
ing off ; he killed the friends who came to help the king,
he drove the king's servants away ; he took King Jolm
to England, and would not let him return to France again
until he had paid an enormous sum for his ransom. And
this was the man who called upon Heaven to defend the
right ! Ah, my dears, there is not a crowned ruffian in
Europe who has not uttered the same cry these thousand
years past, attesting Heaven in behalf of his unjust quarrel,
and murdering and robbing with the most sacred of all
names in his mouth.

Perhaps the most annoying part of the whole imprison-
ment to poor King John must have been the abominable
politeness and humility of his captor. Taken prisoner, and
his grand army routed by a handful of starving brigands,
the king was marched to supper in the conqueror's tent.



MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES. 61

the prince complimenting him by saying that his victory
was all chance, that the king ought to have won it (and so
he ought, and no mistake), and that his Majesty was the
"garland of chivalry." Nor would he sit down in his
Majesty's presence — not he — he said he was the sub-
ject and only fit to wait upon the king (to wait upon him
and rob him) ; so he fetched the dishes, drew the corks,
and performed all the duties of his Majesty's Yellowplush.

His conduct in carrying his prisoner to London was of
the same sort. He had a triumphal entry : the king being
placed on a great horse, the prince meekly riding a pony be-
side him, and all the people, of course, shouting " Long live
the prince ! " What humility ! cry the historians ; what
noble conduct ! No, no, my loves, I say it was sham hu-
mility, the very worst sort of pride ; if he wanted to spare
his prisoner's feelings, why didn't the prince call a hackney-
coach?

In the year 1376, twenty years after his victory of Poic-
tiers, the gallant Black Prince (who in France and Spain,
at the head of his famous free companies, had fought many
a hai'd fight since then) died, leaving an only son behind
him. Old King Edward, who had been battling and fight-
ing as much as his son, now in his old age had grown dot-
ingly fond of a wicked hussy, Alice Pierce by name, that
had been maid of honor to the good Queen Philippa. The
king gave to this good-for-nothing creature all the queen's
jewels, she had the giving away of all the places about the
court, and behaved in such a way that the Parliament was
obliged to stop her extravagance.

A year after his son, the famous old warrior. King Ed-
ward the Third, felt that death was coming upon him ; and
called his beloved Alice Pierce to come and console him ere
he died. She, seeing death on his face, took the expiring
monarch's hand in hers, and pulled his ring off his finger.
The servants pillaged the wardrobes and the hangings of
the bed, and dying Edward, the terror of Frenchmen, lay
unheeded upon his bed, until a priest came by chance into
the room, and knelt down by the king's side, and said a
prayer with him for the safety of his soul, at the end whereof
the priest alone had the power of saying " Amen."

Here Miss Tickletoby paused with a very solemn voice,
and the little children retired quite wistfully and silently,
and were all particularly good in school the next day.

LECTURE X.



EDWARD III.



THE reign of the third Edward has always been con-
sidered a glorious period of our annals — the fact is,
he beat the French soundly, and it is always a comfort to
read of those absurd vaporing vainglorious Frenchmen ob-
taining a beating — and he has had for an historian of his
battles one John Froissart, a very bad clergyman, as I make
no doubt, but a writer so exceedingly lively and pleasant,
that the scenes of the war are made to pass before the
reader as if he saw them. No — not as if he saw them
in reality, by the way, but as if he beheld them well acted
in a theatre, the principal characters represented by Mr.
Charles Kean and other splendid stars of the stage.

So there is nothing but fighting in the works of the Rev-
erend John Froissart — nothing but fighting and killing :
yet all passes with such brilliancy, splendor, and good hu-
mor, that you can't fancy for the world that anybody is
hurt ; and though the warriors of whom he speaks are some-
times wounded, it really seems as if they liked it. It is —
" Fair sir, shall we for the honor of our ladies, or the love of
the blessed Virgin of Heaven, cut each other's heads off ? ''
" I am unworthy to have the honor of running through
the body such a flower of chivalry as you," replies the other ;
and herewith smiling sweetly on each other, gaudy with
plumes, and gold, and blazing coats of armor, bestriding
prancing war-horses covered also with gay housings and
bright steel, at it the two gentlemen go, with lances in rest,
shouting their war-cries gayly. " A Manny ! a Manny ! "
" Our Lady for Alengon ! " says one to the other. " For the
love of the saints parry me that cut, sir," says Sir Walter
Manny, delivering it gracefully with his heavy battle-sword.
" Par la Sambleau, beau sire, voilk un beau coup d'espee,"
says the constable to the other, politely, who has just split
his nose in two, or carried off his left whisker and cheek :
and the common people go to work just as genteelly;

fancied their vennrable instructress mad — while
Master T.iii.so's, who believed he had been elevated for
the purpose of being flogged, set up a roar which
caused the worthy lady to put him quickly down

But to speak of King Edward III. The first act of his
reign may be said to have been the seizing of one Mortimer,
the Queen's lover, whom he caused to be hanged, and of
her Majesty, whom he placed in a castle, where she lived
for the last seven-and-twenty years of her life, with a hand-
some allowance made to her by her son.

The chief of his time hereafter was filled up with wars
— those wars which are so pleasant to read of in Froissart,
before mentioned, but which I need not tell any little child
here who ever by chance has had a black eye or a whipping,
are by no means pleasant in reality. When we read that
the king's son, the Black Prince, burned down no less than
five hundred towns and villages in the south of France,
laying the country waste round about them, and driving
the population Heaven knows where, you may fancy what
the character of these wars must have been, and that if
they were good fun to the knights and soldiers, they were
by no means so pleasant to the people.

By such exploits, however, the reign of Edward is to be
noted. Robert Bruce being dead, and his son a child, Ed-
ward fell on the Scots, slaughtered forty thousand of them
at Halidon Hill, and aided the younger Baliol, who in re-
turn promised the submission of himself and kingdom to
England, to take a temporary possession of the throne. The
Scotch, however, soon rose against Baliol ; and Edward
Bruce got back his crown — such as it was.

Then our lord Sir Edward took a fancy to France, and,
upon a most preposterous claim advanced by him, assumed
the French arms, called himself king of that country, and
prepared to take possession of the same. The first thing
he did, to this end, was to obtain a glorious victory over the
French navy, taking no less than two hundred and forty of
their ships, and killing I don't know how many thousands
of their men.

I don't know if the French wore "wooden shoes" in
those days, but the English hated them for that or some
other equally good cause; and the Parliaments for ever
granted the king money to carry on the war in assertion of
his just rights. Just rights, forsooth ! — a private man
putting forward such claims to another's purse, and claim-
ing his just rights with a pistol at your head, would be
hanged for his pains. Bishops and priests said prayers for
King Edward, and judges and lawyers wrote long lying doc-
uments in support of his cause.



MISS TICKLETOBTS LECTURES. 65

In spite of the hundreds of thousands of pounds which
his subjects gave him, and the hundreds of thousands of men
he brought into the field against the King of France, Ed-
ward for some time made very little way, and did not over-
come the French kinr^'s armies — for the very good reason,
that the latter would never meet him. And it is a singular
thing, that when the two armies did meet, and the English
obtained those two victories about which we have been
bragging for near five hundred years, we did not fight until
we were forced, and because we could not help it. Burn-
ing, robbing, ravaging, Edward's troops had arrived at the
gates of Paris, not with the hope of conquering the country,
but of plundering it simply ; and were making the best of
their way home again from the pursuit of an immense
French army which was pressing them very hard, when
Edward, finding he could not escape without a fight, took a
desperate stand and the best ground he could find on the
famous hill of Cressy.

Here, sheltered amidst the vines, the English archers
and chivalry took their posts ; and the blundering French,
as absurdly vain and supercilious in those days as they are
at this moment, thinking to make easy work of ces coquins
d^ Anglais, charged the hill and the vineyards — not the
English, who were behind them, and whose arrows slaugh-
tered them without pity.

When the huge mass of the French army was thrown
into disorder by these arrows, the English riders issued out
and plunged among them, murdering at their ease ; and the
result was a glorious triumph to the British arms. King
Edward's son, a lad of fourteen, distinguished himself in
the fight, holding his ground bravely against the only re-
spectable attack which the French seem to have made in
the course of the day. And ever since that day, the princes
of Wales, as you know, have had for a crest that of an old
King of Bohemia (the blind old fool !), who could not see
the English, but bade his squires lead him towards them,
so that he might exchange a few coups de lance with them.
So the squires laced their bridles into his, made their attack,
and were run through the body in a minute ; and serve 'em
RIGHT, say I.

Whilst Edward was fighting this battle, those marauding
Scotchmen, under David Bruce their new king (as great a
robber, my dears, as his father), thought they might take
advantage of the unprotected state of the kingdom, and

came across the border in great force, to plunder as usual
But I am happy to say tliat her Majesty, Queen Philippa,
heading a small English army, caught them at a place caifed
Nevil's Cross, and utterly defeated the thievish rogues, kill-
ing vaat numbers of them. She was as kind-hearted, too,
as she was brave. For at the siege of Calais, after Edward
had reduced the town, he swore, in his rage at the resistance
of the garrison, that lie would hang six of the principal in-
habitants. These unhappy six came before him " in their
shirts, with haltera round their necks," the old chroniclers
say, and as, in fact, is proved by their portraits below.




The queen interceded for their lives ; the monarch granted
her prayer, and her Majesty gave the poor burghers what
must have been very acceptable to them after six months'
starvation ; a comfortable meal of victuals.

" I hope they went home first to dress for dinner," here
remarked an intelligent pupil.

" Of course they must have done so, my dear," answered
Miss Tiekletoby ; " but, for my part, I believe that the irhole

scene must have been aiTanged previously between the king
aaid queen ; indeed, as you will see by the picture, neither
of them can help laughing at the ridiculous figure the
burghers cut."

The company separated in immense good-humor, saying
that the Lecturer had, on this occasion, mingled amusement
with much stem instruction.

"I will go to Dover to-morrow/' I said, "and take the
first packet that goes — that goes anywhere."

I am at Dover. This is written from the Ship Hotel : let
me recollect the adventures of the day.

The Dover trains go from two places at once : but my be-
lief is, the cabmen try and perplex you. If it is the turn
of the Bricklayers' Arms train, they persuade you to Lon-
don Bridge ; if of the London Bridge, they inveigle you to
the Bricklayers' Arms — through that abominable suburb
stretching away from Waterloo Bridge, and into the Greater
London, which seems as it were run to seed.

I passed a theatre — these creatures have a theatre it ap-
pears — it is called (to judge from a painted placard) the
Victoria. It is a brick building, large, and with the win-
dows cracked and stuffed with coats.

At the Bricklayers' Arms, which we reached at length
after paying several base turnpikes, and struggling through
a noisy, dirty, bustling, dismal city of small houses and
queer shops and gin-palaces — the policeman comes grin-
ning up to the cab, and says, " No train from here, sir —
next train from London Bridge — hoften these mistakes.
Cab drove away only just this minute. You'll be in time
if you go."

The cabman gallops off, with a grin. The brute ! he knew
it well enough. He went for an extra fare.

As I do not wish to have a coup-de-soleil ; or to be blinded
with dust ; or to have my nerves shattered by the infernal
screaming of the engine as we rush howling through the
tunnels ; as I wish to sit as soft as I can in this life, and
find a board by no means so elastic as a cushion, I take the
first-class, of course. — I should prefer having some of the
third-class people for company, though — I find them gen-
erally less vulgar than their betters.

I selected, as may be imagined, an empty carriage : in
which I lived pretty comfortably until we got to Reigate,
where two persons with free tickets — engineers and Scotch-
men — got into the carriage.

Of course one insisted upon sitting down in the very seat
opposite me. There were four seats, but he must take that,
on purpose to mingle his legs with mine, and make me un-
comfortable. I removed to the next seat — the middle one.
This was what the wretch wanted. He plumped into my
place. He had the two places by the window — the two
best in the coach — he leered over my shoulder at his com-
rade a great, coarse, hideous Scotch smile.



WANDERINGS OF OUR FAT CONTRIBUTOR. 71

I hate engineers, I hate Scotchmen, I hate brutes with
free tickets, who take the places of gentlemen who pay.

On alighting at Dover, and remembering the extravagance
of former charges at the " Ship," under another proprietor
(pray heavens the morrow's little bill may be a mild one !),
I thought of going elsewhere. Touters were about seizing
upon the passengers and recommending their hotels —
" Now, Gents, the ' Gun ' ! " roared one monster. I turned
sickening away from him. « Take me to the ' Ship/ " I
faintly gasped.

On proposing dinner, the waiter says with an air as if he
was inventing something extremely clever, " Whiting, sir ?
Nice fried sole ? "

Mon Dieu / what have I done to be pursued in this way
by whiting and fried sole ? Is there nothing else in the
world? Ain't I sick of fried sole and whiting — whiting
and fried sole ? Having eaten them for long years and
years until my soul is weary of them. " You great ass,"
I felt inclined to exclaim, " I can get whiting and sole in
London, give me something new ! "

Ah for that something new ! I have seen the dry toast
come up for my breakfast so many many times — the same
old tough stiff leathery tasteless choky dry toast, that I can
bear it no longer. The other morning (I had been rather
feverish all night) it came up and I declare I burst into
tears.

" Why do you haunt me," I said, " you demd old toast ?
What have I done that there is no other companion for me
but you ? I hate and spurn you — and yet up you come.
I^ay by day, heartless brute, I leave you in the rack, and
yet it's not you that suffer torture : " and I made a pas-
sionate speech to that toast full of eloquence, and howled
and flung the plateful at the door — just as Mary came in.

She is the maid. She could not understand my feelings.
She is contented with toast for breakfast, with bread I be-
lieve, poor wretch ! So are cows contented with grass.
Horses with corn. The fine spirit pants for novelty — and
mine is sick of old toast.

"Gents" are spoken of familiarly even at this hotel.
During dinner a messenger comes to ask if a young " gent "
was dining in the coffee-room ?

" No," says the waiter.

" How is that," thinks I, " am I not a young gent my-
self ? " He continues, " There's two holdish ladies and a



72 PAPERS BY THE FAT CONTRIBUTOR.

very young gent in Ko. 24 ; but therms only a middle-haged
gent in the coffee-room"

Has it come to this, thea ? Thirty something last birth-
day, ajid to be called a middle-^ed gent ? Away ! Away !
I can bear this ribaldiy no more. Perhaps the sea may
console me.

And how ? it's only a dim straight line of horizon, with
no gayety or variety in it. A few wretched little vessels
are twiddling up and down. A steam-tug or two — yachts
more or less — the town is hideous, except for a neat row
of houses or two — the cliffs only respectable. The castle
loots tolerable. But who, I should like to know, would be
such a fool as to climb up to it ? Hark ! There is a band
playing — it is a long mile on, and yet I go to listen to it.

It is a band of wind-instruments of course, a military
band, and the wretches listening in their stupid good-humor
are giving the players — beer, I knew what would happen
immediately upon the beer (I'm forbidden it myselO. They
played so infernally out of tune that they blasted me off
the groimd — away from the Dover bucks, and the poor
girls in their cheap finery, and the grinning yokels, ami the
maniacs riding veloeipedes.




This is what I saw most worthy of remark all day. This
person was standing on the beach, and her garments flapped

round about her in the breeze. She stood and looked and
looked until somebody came — to her call apparently. Some-
body, a male of her species, dressed in corduroys and a frock.
Then they paired off quite happy.
That thing had a lover !

Good-night, I can say no more. A monster has just told
me that a vessel starts at seven for Ostend : I will take it.
I would take one for Jericho if it started at six.

HAD one comfort in quitting Dover. It was to see
Towzer, my tailor, of Saint James's Street, lounging
albout the pier in a marine jacket, with a tuft to his chin.

His face, when he saw me in the boat, was one of the
most intense agony. I owe Towzer 203^.

" Good-bye, Towzer," I said. " I shall be back in four
years." And I laughed a demoniac yell of scorn, and tum-
bled clattering down the brass stairs of the cabin.

An Israelite had already taken the best place, and was
preparing to be unwell. I have observed that the " Mosaic
Arabs," as Coningsby calls them, are always particularly
amenable to maritime discomjQture. The Jew's internal
commotions were frightful during the passage.

Two Oxford youths, one of whom had been growing a
moustache since the commencement of the vacation, began
to smoke cigars, and assume particularly piratical airs.

I took the picture of one of them an hour afterwards —
stretched lifeless on the deck, in the agonies of sea-sickness.

I will not print that likeness. It is too excellent. If his
mamma saw it, she would catch her death of fright, and
order her darling Tommy home. I will rather publish the
one on the following page.

That man is studying Levizac's grammar. He is a
Scotchman. He has not the least sense of modesty. As
he gets up phrases out of that stale old grammar of 1803
(bought cheap on a stall in Glasgow), the wretch looks up,
and utters the sentences he has just acquired — serves
them up hot in his hideous jargon. " Parly voo Fransis,"
says he, or " Pranny garde de mong tait." He thinks he
has quite the accent. He never doubts but that he is in a
situation to cope with the natives. And au fait, he speaks
French as well as many Belgians or Germans in those lands

Poor Caledonian youth ! I have been CTamming him
with the most dreadful lies all the way. I should have ut-
terly bewildered him, and made him mad with lies, but for
this circumstance : —

In the middle of a rery big one, which (administered by
me) was slipping down his throat as glibly as an oyater.




there came up from the cabin a young woman, not very
pretty, but kind-looking, and she uiid her hand upon the
shoulder of that Levizac-reading Scotchman, and smiled,
and he said, with an air of immense superiority —

" Wall, Eliza, are ye batter noo ? "

It was his wife ] She loved him. She was partial to
that snob. She did not mind the string of Ms shirt-collar
sticking out behind his back.

Gentle Eliza ! a man whom you love and whose exposed
follies would give you pain shall never be made the butt of
the Fat Contributor.

It will hardly be credited — but, upon my honor, there
are four people on deck learning French dialogues as hard
as they can. There is the Oxford man who is not sick. A
young lady who is to be the spokeswoman of her party of
nine. A very pompous man, who swore last night in my
hearing that he was a capital hand at French, and the Cale-
donian student before mentioned.

What a wise race 1 They learn French phrases to speak
to Oerman waiters, who understand English perfectly.

his lordship — a noble-looking person. But just when I
thought he might be on the point of asking me to Muffing-
ton Castle, he got up suddenly, and said, " Yes, my lord,"
to a fellow I never should have suspected of a coronet.
Yet he was the noble earl, and my friend was but his
flunkey.

Such is life ! and so may its most astute observers be
sometimes deceived.

OsTBKD, August 6.

While the couriers, commissioners, footmen, gentlemen,
ladies'-maids, Scotchman with the shirt-collar, the resusci-
tated Oxford youth, the family of nine, and the whole ship's
passengers are struggling, pufBug, stamping, squeezing,
bawling, cursing, tumbling over their boxes and one an-
other's shins, losing their keys, screaming to the commis-
sioners, having their treasures unfolded, their wonderful
packed boxes unpacked so that it is impossible ever to
squeeze the articles back into their receptacles again ; while
there is such a scene of Babel clatter and confusion around
me, ah ! let me thank Heaven that I have but a carpet-bag !

Any man going abroad who purchases this number of
Punch 2i, day previous to his departure, will bless me for
ever. Only take a carpet-bag ! You can have everything
there taste or luxury demands ; six shirts, a fresh suit of
clothes, as many razors as would shave the guards of a reg-
iment of Turks, and what more does a traveller require ?
Buy nothing ! Get a reading of Murray's Guide-book from
your neighbor, and be independent and happy.

My acquaintance, the Hon. James Jillyflower, was in the
boat with fifteen trunks as I am a sinner. He was induced
to take packages for his friends. This is the beauty of bag-
gage — if you have a bag, you can refuse. On this score I
refused twenty-four numbers of the Metropolitan Magazine,
2i teapot, and a ham — which he accepted.

Lady Scram jaw — the packet was opened before my eyes
by the custom-house officers at Ostend — gave Jillyflower a
parcel of law papers to carry to Italy — " only deeds, upon
her honor " — and deeds they were, but with six pair of
gloves inside. All his fifteen trunks were opened in
consequence of that six pair of gloves. He is made miser-
able for those gloves. But what cares Lady Scramjaw ?
Let all travellers beware, then, and again and again bless
me for the hint.

I liave no passport. They have arrested me.

I am about to be conducted to the police. I may be put

into a dungeon like O'Connell. Tyrants! lead on !

• ••••••• •

I was not led to prison, as might have been expected. I
was only conducted to a corner of the room, where was an
official with large mustachios and a conical cap. Eying
me with lowering brows, the following dialogue took place
between me and this myrmidon of tyrants : —

Man in the Cap. Monsieur, votre passeport.

Fat Contributor, Monsieur, je n'en ai pas.

Man in the Cap, Alors, Monsieur, vous pourrez passer
k votre hdtel.

Fat Contributor, Bonjour, Monsieur (ici le Gros.Eedac-
teur tire un pro fond coup de chapeau).

Man in the Cap, Monsieur, je vous salue.

We separated. I want to know how long Britons are to
be subjected to such grinding oppression ?

We went then to our hdtel — the H6tel des Bains. We
were so foolish as to order champagne for dinner. It is the
worst champagne I ever drank in my life : worse than cham-
pagne at Vau^all — worse than used to be supplied by a
wine-merchant at the University — worse even than the
Bordeaux provided in the H6tel des Bains. Good heavens !
is it for this I am come abroad ?

Is it for this ? To drink bad wine — to eat fried soles as
tough as my shoe — to have my nerves agitated about a
passport — and, by way of a second course, to be served
with flabby raw mutton-chops ? Away I I can get these
in Chancery Lane. Is there not such a place as Greenwich
in the world ? and am I come two hundred miles for such
an iniquitous dinner as this ?

I thought of going back again. Why did I come away ?
If there had been a gig at the door that instant to carry me
to my native country, I would have jumped in. But there
is no hope. Look out of the window, miserable man, and
see you are a stranger in a foreign land. There is an ale-
house opposite, with " hier verkoopt man tranken " over
the porch. A woman is standing before me — a woman in
wooden shoes. She has a Belgic child at her neck, another
at her side in little wooden shoekins.

To them approaches their father — a mariner — he kisses
his wife, he kisses his children, and what does he do next ?

Fancy its expression of gratitude, ye kind souls who read

pleased me. It went to the heart through the nose. Ah !

defend their delicate faces from the storms of life. I am
alone in the world — sad and lonely. I have nobody to
blow my nose. There are others yet more wretched, who
must steal the handkerchief with which they perform the
operation.

I could bear that feeling of loneliness no longer. Away 1
let us hasten to the dyke to enjoy the pleasures of the place.

All Ostend is there, sitting before the Itestaurant, and sip-
ping ices as the sun descends into the western wave.

Look at his round disc as it sinks into the blushing
waters ! — look, too, at that fat woman bathing — as round




as the sun. She wears a brown dressing-^own — two bathers
give her each a hand — she advances backwards towards the
coming wave, and as it reaches her — plop ! she sits down
in it.

She emei^es, pufSng, wheezing, and shaking herself. She
retires, creeping up the steps of the bathing-machine. She
is succeeded by other stout nymphs, disporting in the waves.
For hours and hours the Ostenders look on at this enchant-
ing sight.

The Ostend oyster is famous in Paria, and the joy of the
gormandizer. Our good-natured neighbors would not enjoy
tiiem, perhaps, did they know of what country these oysters
are natives.

At Ostend they are called English oysters. Yes ; they
are bom upon the shores of Albion. They are brought to
Belgium young, and educated there. Poor molluscous ex-
iles ! they never see their country again.

We rose at four, to be ready for the train. A ruffianly
Boots (by what base name they denominate the wretch in
this country I know not) was pacing the corridors at half-
past two.

Why the deuce will we get up so confoundedly early on
a journey ? Why do we persist in making ourselves miser-
alue ? — depriving our souls of sleep, scuffling through our
blessed meals, that we may be early on the road ? Is not
the eight of a good comfortable breakfast more lovely than

any landscape in any country ? And what turn in the
prospect is so charming as the turn in a clean snug bed,
and another snooze of half-an-hour ?

This alone is worth a guinea of any man's money. If
you are going to travel, never lose your natural rest for
anything. The prospect that you want to see will be there
next day. You can't see an object fairly unless you have
had your natural sleep. A woman in curl-papers, a man
unshorn, are not fit to examine a landscape. An empty
stomach ma^es blank eyes. If you would enjoy exterior
objects well, dear friend, let you inner man be comfortable.

Above all, young traveller, take my advice and never,
never, be such a fool as to go up a mountain, a tower, or a
steeple. I have tried it. Men still ascend eminences to
this day, and, descending, say they have been delighted.
But it is a lie. They have been miserable the whole day.
Keep you down : and have breakfast while the asinine hun-
ters after the picturesque go braying up the hill.

It is a broiling day. Some arduous fellow-countrymen,
now that we have arrived, think of mounting the tower of

ANTWERP.

Let you and me rather remain in the cool Cathedral, and
look at the pictures there, painted by the gentleman whom
Lady Londonderry calls Eeuben.

We examined these works of art at our leisure. We
thought to ourselves what a privilege it is to be allowed to
look at the works of Eeuben (or any other painter) after
the nobility have gazed on them ! " What did the Noble
Marquis think about Eeuben ? " we mentally inquired — it
would be a comfort to know his opinion : and that of the
respected aristocracy in general.

So thought some people at the tabled' hdtfiy near whom we
have been sitting. Poor innocents ! How little they knew
that the fat gentleman opposite was the contributor of —
ha! ha!

My mind fills with a savage exultation every now and
then, as, hearing a piece of folly, I say inwardly — " Ha,
my fine fellow ! you are down." The poor wretch goes pot-

Punch that day fortnight.

There is something fierce, mighty, savage, inquisitorial,
demoniac, in the possession of that power ! But we wield

hands of the inexperienced to hold the thunderbolts of

I therefore pursued a rapid course to Paris, and thence to

As Havre is the dullest place on earth, I quitted it the

balm, real balm. A myriad of twinkling stars glittered

down on the deck which bore the Fat Contributor to his
native shores — the crescent moon shone in a sky of the
most elegant azure, and myriads of dimples decked the
smiling countenance of the peaceful main. I was so ex-
cited I would not turn into bed, but paced the quarter-deck
all night, singing my favorite sea songs — all the pieces out
of all the operas which I had ever heard, and many more
tunes which I invented on the spot, but have forgotten long
since.

I never passed a more delicious night. I lay down hap-
pily to rest, folded in my cloak — the eternal stars above
me, and beneath me a horsehair mattress, which the steward
brought from below. When I rose like a giant refreshed at
mom, Wight was passed ; the two churches of Southampton
lay on my right hand ; we were close to the pier.

"What is yonder steamer?" I asked of the steward,
pointing to a handsome, slim, black craft that lay in the
harbor — a flag of blue, red, white, and yellow on one mast ;
a blue-peter (signal of departure) at another.

" That," said the steward, " is the Peninsular and Orien-
tal Steam Navigation Company's ship * Lady Maiy Wood.'
She leaves port to-day for Gibraltar, touching on her way at
Vigo, Oporto, Lisbon, and Cadiz."

I quitted the "Ariadne" — Jason did the same in Lem-
prik'e's Dictionary, and she consoled herself with drinking,
it is said — I quitted the ship, and went to the inn, with
the most tremendous thoughts heaving, panting, boiling, in
my bosom I

" Lisbon ! " I said, as I cut into a cold round of beef for
breakfast (if I have been in foreign pai-ts for a week, I al-
ways take cold beef and ale for breakfast), " Lisbon ! " I
exclaimed, " the flexive du Tage ! the orange-groves of Cin-
tra ! the vast towers of Mafra, Belem, the Gallegos, and the
Palace of Necessidades ! Can I see all these in a week ?
Have I courage enough to go and see them ? " I took an-
other cut at the beef.

" What ! " continued I (my mouth full of muffin), " is it
possible that I, sitting here as I am, may without the least
trouble, and at a trifling expense, transport myself to Cadiz,
skimming over the dark blue sea to the land of the Som-
brero and the Seguidilla — of the Puchera, the Muchacha,
and the Abanico ? If I employ my time well, I may see a
bull-fight, an auto-dd-fe, or at least a revolution. I may

as it tinkles beneath the balcony of Rosiua ! " — " What

time does the ' Maiy Wood ' go, ivaiter ? " I cried.

The slave replied she n^ent at half-past three.

" And does she make Gibraltar ? " I continued. " Say,
John, will she land me at Gibel el Altar ? opposite the
coasts of Afric, whence whilom swarmed the galleys of the
Moor, and landed on the European shores the dusky squad-
rons of the Moslemah ? Do you mean to say, Thomas, that
if I took ray passage in yon boat, a few days would trana-




port me to the scene renowned in British story — the for-
tress seized by Eooke, and g^iarded by Eliott ? Shall I be
able to see the smoking ruins of Tangiers, which the savage
bully of Gaul burned down in braggadocio pride ? "

" Would you like anything for dinner before you go ? "
William here rather sulkily interrupted me ; "I can't be
arlistening to you all day — there's the bell of 24 ringing
like mad."

My repast was by this time concluded — the last slice of
boiled beef made up my mind completely. I went forth to
the busy town — I sought a ready-made linen warehouse —
and in the twinkling of an eye I purchased all that was
necessary for a two months' voyage.

From that moment I let my mustachios grow. At a quar-
ter-past three, a mariner of a stout but weather-beaten
appearance, with a quantity of new carpet-bags and port-
manteaus, containing twenty-four new shirts (six terrifically
striped), two dozen ditto stockings — in brief, everything
necessary for travel — tripped lightly up the ladder of the
" Lady Mary Wood."

I made a bow as I have seen T. P. Cooke do it on the
stage. " Avast there, my hearty," I said ; " can you tell
me which is the skipper of this here craft, and can a sea-
man get a stowage in her ? "

" I am the captain," said the gentleman, rather surprised.

" Tip us your daddle then, my old sea-dog, and give us
change for this here Henry Hase."

'Twas a bank-note for 100/., and the number was 33769.

THE SHIP AT SEA, DOLORES !

HE first thing that a narrow-
* minded individual does on
shipboard is to make his own
berth comfortable at the ex-
pense of his neighbors. The
next is to criticise the pas-
sengers round about him.

Do you remark, when Brit-
ons meet, with what a scowl
they salute each other, as
much as to say, " Bless your
eyes, what the angel do you
do here ? " Young travellers,
that is to say, adopt this
fascinating mode of intro-
duction. I am old in voyaging — I go up with a bland
smile to one and every passenger. I originate some clever
observation about the fineness of the weather ; if there are
ladies, I manage to make some side appeal to them, which
is sure of a tender appreciation ; above all, if there are old
ladies, fat ladies, very dropsical, very sea-sick, or ugly ladies,
I pay some delicate attention — I go up and insinuate a pil-
low under their poor feet. In the intervals of sickness I
whisper, " A leetle hot sherry and water ? " All these lit-
tle kindnesses act upon their delicate hearts, and I know
that they say to themselves, " How exceedingly polite and
well-bred that stout young man is ! "
" It's a pity he's so fat," says one.
" Yes, but then he's so active," ejaculates another.
And thus, my dear and ingenuous youth who read this,
and whom I recommend to lay to heart every single word
of it — I am adored by all my fellow-passengers. When
they go ashore they feel a pang at parting with their amiable
companion. I am only surprised that I have not been voted

several pieces of plate upou these occasions — perliapa, dear
youth, if you follow my example, you may be more lucky.

Acting upon this benevolent plan, I shall begin satii^
ically to describe the social passengers that tread with me
the deck of the " Lady Mary Wood." I shall not, like that
haughty and supercilious wretch with the yellow whiskers,
yonder, cut short the gentle efforts at good fellowship which
human beings around me may make — or grumble at the
diimer, or the head-wind, or the narrowness of the berths,
or the jarring of the engines — but shall make light of all
these — nay, by ingenuity, turn them to a facetious and
moral purpose. Here, for instance, is a picture of the ship.




taken imder circumstances of great difficulty — over the

mops, cabin-boys, black engineers, and oily cook's assistants
emei^e ; above is the deck between the two paddle-boxes,
on which the captain walks in his white trousers and tele-
scope (you may catch a glimpse of the former), and from
which in bad weather he, speaking-trumpet in hand, rides
the whirlwind and directs the storm. Those are the buckets
in case of fire ; see how they are dancing about ! because
they have nothing else to do — I trust they will always re-
main idle. A ship on fire Is a conveyance by which I have
no mind to travel.

Farther away, by the quarter-deck ladder, you see accu-
rate portraits of Messrs. MacWhirter and MacMurdo, of
Oporto and Saint Mair's, wine-merchants ; and far far away,
on the quarter-deck, close by the dark helmsman, with the
binnacle shining before his steadfast eyes, and the English
fl^ streaming behind him — (it is a confounded bead-wind)

I write her name with a sort of despair. I think it is
four hours ago since I wrote that word on the paper. They
were at dinner, but (for a particular reason) I cared not to
eat, and sat at my desk apart. The dinner went away,
either down the throats of the eager passengers, or to the
black caboose whence it came — dessert passed — the sun
set — tea came — the moon rose — she is . now high in
heaven, and the steward is laying the supper things, and
all this while I have been thinking of Dolores, Dolobes,
Dolores !

She is a little far-off in the picture ; but by the aid of a.
microscope, my dear sir, you may see eveiy lineament of



WANDERINGS OF OUR FAT CONTRIBUTOR, 89

her delicious countenance — every fold of the drapery which
adorns her fair form, and falls down to the loveliest foot in
the world ! Did you ever see anything like that ankle ? —
those thin open-worked stockings make my heart thump in
an indescribable rapture. I would drink her health out of
that shoe; but I swear it would hot hold more than a
liqueur-glass of wine. Before she left us — ah me ! that I
should have to write the words left us — I tried to make
her likeness ; but the abominable brute of a steam-engine
shook so, that — would you believe it ? — the above draw-
ing is all I could make of the loveliest face in the world !

I look even at that with a melancholy pleasure. It is
not very like her, certainly ; but it was drawn from her —
it is not the rose, but it has been near it. Her complexion
is a sort of gold color — her eyes of a melting, deep, un-
f athomably deep, brown — and as for her hair, the varnish
of my best boots for evening parties is nothing compared to
it for blackness and polish.

She used to sit on the quarter-deck of sunny afternoons,
and smoke paper-cigars — oh if you could have seen how
sweetly she smiled and how prettily she puffed out the
smoke ! I have got a bit of one of them which has been at
her sweet lips. I shall get a gold box to keep it in some
day when I am in cash. There she sat smoking, and the
young rogues of the ship used to come crowding round her.
MacWhirter was sorry she didn't stop at Oporto, MacMurdo
was glad because she was going to Cadiz — T warrant he
was — my heart was burst asunder with a twang and a snap,
and she carried away half of it in the Malta boat, which
bore her away from me forever.

Dolores was not like your common mincing English girls
— she had always a repartee and a joke upon her red lips
which made everyone around her laugh — some of these
jokes I would repeat were it not a breach of confidence, and
had they not been uttered in the Spanish language, of which
I don't understand a word. So I used to sit quite silent
and look at her full in the face for hours and hours, and
offer her my homage that way.

You should have seen how Dolores ate too ! Our table
was served four times a day — at breakfast, with such deli-
cacies as beefsteaks, bubble-and-squeak, fried ham and eggs,
hashed goose, &c., twice laid — of all which trifles little
Dolores would have her share ; the same at dinner when she
was well ; and when beneath the influence of angry Nep-

tune the poor soul was stretched in the berth of sickness,
the stewards would nevertheless bear away plates upon
plates of victuals to the dear suffering girl ; and it would
be " Irish stew for a lady, if you please, sir ; " — " Rabbit
and onions for the ladies' cabin ; " — " Duck, if you please,
and plenty of stuffing, for the Spanish lady." And such is
our blind partiality when the heart is concerned, that I ad-
mired that conduct in my Dolores which I should have de-
tested in other people. For instance, if I had seen Miss
Jones or Miss Smith making peculiar play with her knife,
or pulling out a toQthpick after dinner, what would have
been my feelings !

when Steward brought to my couch a plateful of Sea-Pie (I
called wildly for it, having read of the dish in maritime
novels), why is it that the onions of which that delectable
condiment seems to be mainly composed caused a convul-

agonized frame, obliging me to sink back gasping in the
crib, and to forego all food for ma.ny many hours ':■

I think it must be my love for Dolores that causes this
desperate disinclination for food, and yet I have been in

lost my desire for my regular four meals a day. I believe I
must be very far gone this time.

my spirits — I wish — I wish she hadn't a partiality for
that particular vegetable.

It IS the next day. I have lost almost all count of time ;
and only know how to trace it faintly, by remembering the
champagne days — Thursday and Sunday.

I am abominably hungry. And yet when I tried at
breakfast ! — horror ! — I was obliged to plunge back to
the little cabin again, and have not been heard of since.
Since then I have been lying on my back, sadly munching
biscuit and looking at the glimmer of the sun through the
deadlight overhead.

I was on the sofa, enjoying (if a wretch so miserable can
be said to enjoy anything) the fresh sea-breeze which came
through the open port-hole, and played upon my dewy
brow. But a confounded great wave came flouncing in at
the orifice, blinded me, wet me through, wet all my Hnen in
the carpet-bag, rusted all my razors, made water-buckets of
my boots, and played the deuce with a tin of sweet biscuits
which have formed my only solace.

Ha ! ha ! What do I want with boots and razors ? I
could not put on a boot now if you were to give me a
thousand guineas. I could not shave if my life depended
on it. I think I could cut my head off — but the razors are
rusty and would not cut clean. Dolores, Dolores I

The hunger grows worse and worse. It seems to me an
age since butcher's meat passed these lips ; and, to add to
my misery I can hear every word the callous wretches are
saying in the cabin ; the clatter of the plates, the popping
of the soda-water corks — or, can it be champagne day,
and I a miserable groveller on my mattress ? The follow-
ing is the conversation : —

Captain, Mr. Jones, may I have the honor of a glass of

And so goes on the horrid talk. They are eating — she

quires, " How is the fat gentleman that was so gay on board

supine in my berth, without even strength enough to pull
the rascal's nose. I detest Smith.

Things look more briskly ; the swell has gone down. We

Dolores is the sun, I am the remainder of the simile.

It is astonishing how a few hours' calm can make one for-

ing elegantly over a yellow bandanna. My mustachios have
come on wonderfully; they are a little red or so. But
the Spanish, they say, like fair faces. I would do any-
thing for Dolores but smoke with her ; that I confess I dare
not attempt.

It is three miles inland, and therefore cannot be seen.
It is famous for the generous wine which bears the name of
port, and is drunk by some after dinner ; by other, and I
think wiser, persons simply after cheese.

As about ten times as much of this liquor ia drunk in
England as is made in Portugal, it is needless to institute
any statistical inquiries into the growth and consumption
of the wine.

Oporto was besieged by Don Miguel, the rightful king,
who, although he had Marshal Bourmont and justice on Ma
side, was defeated by Don Pedio and British Valor. Thus
may our arms ever triumph I These are the only facts I
was enabled to gather regarding Oporto.

New Passengers. — On coming on deck, I was made aware
that we had touched land by the presence on the boat of at




least a hundred passengers, who had not before appeared
among us. They had come from Vigo, and it appears were
no more disposed to rouse at the morning gun than I was ;
for they lay asleep on the fore-deck for the most part, in
the very attitudes here depicted by me.

They were Gallegos going to Lisbon for service ; and I
wished that a better hand than mine — viz., one of those
immortal pencils which decorate the columns of our dear
Punch — had been there to take cognizance of these strange
children of the South — in their scarfs and their tufted hats,
with their brown faces shining as they lay under the sun.

PUNCH IN THE EAST.

FROM OUR FAT CONTRIBUTOR.

On boabd the P. & O. Comfant's ship

" BUERUMPOOTBB," OPP ALEXANDRIA.

FAT CONTRIBUTOE, indeed ! I lay down my pen,
and smile in bitter scorn as I write the sarcastic title

— I remember it was that which. I assumed when my pere-
grinations began. — It is now an absurd misnomer.

I forget whence I wrote to you last. We were but three
weeks from England, I think — off Cadiz, or Malta, perhaps

— I was full of my recollections of Dolores — full in other
ways, too. I have travelled in the East since then. I
have seen the gardens of Bujukdere and the kiosks of the
Seraglio : I have seen the sun sinking behind Morea's hills,
and rising over the red waves of the Nile. I have travelled
like Benjamin Disraeli, Ulysses, Monckton Milnes, and the
eminent sages of all times. I am not the fat being I was
(and proudly styled myself) when I left my dear dear Pall
Mall. You recollect my Nugee dress-coat, with the brass
buttons and canary silk lining, that the author of the
" Spirit of the Age " used to envy ? I never confessed it —
but I was in agonies when I wore that coat. I was girthed
in (inwardly) so tight, that I thought every day after the
third entrSe apoplexy would ensue — and had my name and
address written most legibly in the breast-flap, so that I
might be carried home in case I was found speechless in
the street on my return from dinner. A smiling face often
hides an aching heart ; I promise you mine did in that coat,
and not my heart only, but other regions. There is a skele-
ton in every house — and mine — no — I wasn't exactly a
skeleton in that garment, but suffered secret torments in it,
to which, as I take it, those of the Inquisition were trifles.

I put it on t'other day to dine with Bucksheesh Pasha at
Grand Cairo — I could have buttoned the breast over to the
two buttons behind. My dear Sir — I looked like a perfect
Guy. I am wasted away — a fading flower — I don't weigh

above sixteen and a half now. Eastern travel has done it
— and all my fat friends may read this and consider it. It
is something at least to know, Byron (one of ws) took
vinegar and starved himself to get down the disagreeable
plenitude. Vinegar ? — nonsense — try Eastern travel. I
am bound to say, however, that it don't answer in all eases.
Waddilove, for instance, with whom I have been making
the journey, has bulged out in the sun like a pumpkin, and

finement there. One of them hit Colonel Soureillon plump

my own case. A man always speaks most naturally and
truly of that which occurs to himself.




I attribute the diminution in my size not to my want of
appetite, which has been uniformly good. Pale ale is to be
found universally throughout Turkey, Syria, Greece, and
Egypt, and after a couple of foaming bottles of Bass, a man
could eat a crocodile (we had some at Bucksheesh Pasha's
fettened in the tanks of his country villa of El Muddee, on
the Nile, but tough — very fishy and tough) — the appetite,
I say, I have found to be generally good in these regions —
and attribute the corporeal diminution solely to want of

SLEEP.

I give you my word of honor as a gentleman, that for
leven weeks I have never slept a wink. It is my belief that
nobody does in the East. You get to do without it per-
fectly. It may be said of these countries, they are so hoapi-

table, you are never alouf-. You have always friends to
come and pass the night with you, and keep you alive with
their cheerful innocent gambols. At Conatantiuople, at
Athens, Malta, Cairo, Gibraltar, it is all the same. Your
watchful friends persist in paying you attention. The
frisky and agile flea — the slow but steady-purposed bug —
the fairy mosquito with his mellow-soundiiig horn — rush
to welcome the stranger to their shores — aad never leave
him during his stay. At first, and before you axe used to
the manners of the country, the attention is rather annoy-
ing. Here, for instance is my miniature. You will see




that one of my eyes was shut up temporarily, and I drew the
picture by the sole light of the other.

Man is a creature of habit. I did not at first like giving
up my sleep. I had been used to it in England. I occar
sionally repined as my friends persisted in calling my at-
tention to them, grew sulky and peevish, wished myself in
bed in London — nay, in the worst bed in the most fre-
quented, old, mouldy, musty, wooden-galleried coach inn in
Aldgate or Holbom. I recollect a night at the "Bull," in
poor dear old Mrs. Nelson's time — well, well, it is nothing
to the East. What a country would this be for TifSn, and
what a noble field for his labors !

Though I am used to it now, I can't say but it is prob-
able that when I get back to England I shall return to my

old habits. Here, on board the Peninsular and Oriental
Company's magnificent steamship " Burrumpooter," I
thought of trying whether I could sleep any more. I had
got the sweetest little cabin in the world ; the berths rather
small and tight for a man of still considerable proportions

— but everything as neat, sweet, fresh, and elegant as the
most fastidious amateur of the night-cap might desire. I
hugged the idea of having the little palace all to myself.
I placed a neat white nightgown and my favorite pink silk
cap on the top berth ready. The sea was as clear as glass

— the breeze came cool and refreshing through the port-
hole — the towers of Alexandria faded away as our ship
sailed westward. My Egyptian friends were left behind.
It would soon be sunset. I longed for that calm hour, and
meanwhile went to enjoy myself at dinner with a hundred
and forty passengers from Suez, who laughed and joked,
drank champagne and the exhilarating Hodgson, and
brought the latest news from Dumdum or Futtyghur.

I happened to sit next at table to the French gentleman
before mentioned, Colonel Sourcillon, in the service of the
Rajah of Lahore, returning to Europe on leave of absence.
The Colonel is six feet high — with a grim and yellow
physiognomy, with a red ribbon at his button-hole of course,
and large black mustachios curling up to his eyes — to
one eye that is — the other was put out in mortal combat,
which has likewise left a furious purple gash down one
cheek, a respectable but terrible sight.

" Vous regardez ma cicatrice," said the Colonel, perceiv-
ing that I eyed him with interest. " Je Pai re^ue en Es-
pagne. Monsieur, k la bataille de Vittoria, que nous avons
gagn^e sur vous. J'ai tu6 de ma main le grrredin Feld-
marechal Anglais qui m'a donne cette noble blessure. EUe

quatorze cicatrices sur le corps. Mais j'ai fait sonner par-
tout le grrrand nom de Frrance. Vous etes militaire, Mon-
sieur? Non? — Passez-moi le poivre rouge, s'il vous
plait."

The Colonel emptied the cayenne-pepper cruet over his
fish, and directed his conversation entirely to me. He told
me that ours was a perfidious nation, that he esteemed some
individuals, but detested the country, which he hoped to
see ecrrrase un jour. He said I spoke French with remark-
able purity ; that on board all our steamers there was an
infamous conspiracy to insult every person bearing the

name of Frenchman ; that he would call out the Captain
directly they came ashore 5 that he could not even get a
cabin — had I one ? On my affirmative reply, he said I was
a person of such amiable manners, and so unlike my coun-
trymen, that he would share my cabin with me — and in-
stantly shouted to the steward to put his trunks into num-
ber 202.

What could I do ? When I went on deck to smoke a
cigar, the Colonel retired, pretending a petite sante, suffer-
ing a horrible mal de mer, and dreadful shooting pains in
thirty-seven of his wounds. What, I say, could I do ? I
had not the cabin to myself. He had a right to sleep
there — at any rate, I had the best berth, and if he did not
snore, my rest would not be disturbed.

But ah I my dear friends — when I thought I would go
down and sleep — the first sleep after seven weeks — fancy
what I saw — he was asleep in my berth.

His sword, gun, and pistol-cases blocked up the other
sleeping-place; his bags, trunks, pipes, cloaks, and port-
manteaus, every comer of the little room.

" Qui va l1 ? '' roared the monster, with a terrific oath,
as I entered the cabin. " Ah ! c'est vous. Monsieur : pour-
quoi diable faites-vous tant de bruit? J^ai une petite
sant^ ; laissez-moi dormir en paix."

CHAPTER IL

OS THE PG08PECTS OF PUNCH IN THE EAST.

To the Editor ofFunch (confidential).
My dear Sik, — In my last letter 0«^Mchwaa intended
for tlie public eye), I was too much Mfected by the recol-
lection of what I may be permitted to call the




to allow me for the moment to commit to paper that use-
ful information, in the imparting of which your Journal —
our Journal — the world's Journal — yields to none, and
which the British public will naturally expect from all who
contribute to your colunms. I address myself therefore
privately to you, so that you may deal with the facts I may
communicate as you shall think best for the general wel-
fare.

What I wish to point out especially to your notice is, the
astooiahing progress of Punch in the East. Moving ac-
cording to your orders in strict incognito, it has been a
source of wonder and delight to me to hear how often the
name of the noble Miscellany was in the mouths of British
men. At Gibraltar its jokes passed among the midship-
men, merchants, Jews, &c., assembled at the hotel table

(and quite unconscious how sweetly their words sounded
on the ear of a silent guest at the board) as current, ay,
much more current, than the coin of the realm. At Malta,
the first greeting between Captain Tagus and some other
Captain in anchor-buttons, who came to hail him when we
entered harbor, related to Punch, " What's the news ? "
exclaimed the other captain. "Here's Punch/' was the
immediate reply of Tagus, handing it out — and the other
captain's face was suffused with instant smiles as his en-
raptured eye glanced over some of the beauteous designs of
Leech. At Athens, Mr. Smith, second - cousin of the re-
spected vice-consul, who came to our inn, said to me mys-
teriously, " I'm told we've got Punch on board." I took
him aside, and pointed him out (in confidence) Mr. Wad-
dilove, the stupidest man of all our party, as the author in
question.

Somewhat to my annoyance (for I was compelled to main-
tain my privacy), Mr. W. was asked to a splendid dinner
in consequence — a dinner which ought by rights to have
fallen to my share. It was a consolation to me, however,
to think, as I ate my solitary repast at one of the dearest
and worst inns I ever entered, that though / might be over-
looked. Punch was respected in the land of Socrates and
Pericles.

At the Piraeus we took on board four young gentlemen
from Oxford, who had been visiting the scenes consecrated
to them by the delightful associations of the Little Go ; and
as they paced the deck and looked at the lambent stars
that twinkled on the bay once thronged with the galleys of
Themistocles — what, Sir, do you think was the song they
chanted in chorus ? Was it a lay of burning Sappho ? Was
it a thrilling ode of Alcaeus ? No ; it was —

" Had I an ass averse to speed,
Deem ye I'd strike him ? no, indeed/* &c.

which you had immortalized, I recollect, in your sixth vol-
ume. (Donkeys, it must be premised, are most numerous
and flourishing in Attica, commonly bestridden by the mod-
em Greeks, and no doubt extensively popular among the
ancients — unless human nature has very much changed
since their time.) Thus we find that Punch is respected at
Oxford as well as in Athens, and I trust at Cambridge like-
wise.

the Health of Punch was enthusiastically drunk in the deli-
cious beverage which shares his respectable name ; and the
ghosts of Hero and Leander must have been startled at
hearing songs appropriate to the toaat, and very difEerent
from those with which I have no doubt they amused each
other in times so affectin^ly described in Lemprifere's de-
lightful Dictionary. I did not see the Golden Horn at
Constantinople, nor hear it blown, probably on account of
the fog ; but this I can declare, that Punch was on the table
at Misseri's Hotel, Pera, the spirited proprietor of which
little knew that one of its humblest contributors ate his




pilaff. PilafF, by the way, is very good ; kaboba are also
excellent ; ray friend Mehemet Effendi, who keeps the kabob
shop, close by the Kope-bazaar in Constantinople, sells as
good as any in town. At the Armenian shops, too, you get
a sort of raisin wine at two piastres a bottle, over which a
man can spend an agreeable half hour. I did not hear what
the Sultaa Abdul Medjid thinks of Punch, but of wine he
is stdd to be uncomraonly fond.

At Alexandria there lay the picture of the dear and ven-
erable old face, on the table of the British hotel ; and the
140 passengers from BumimtoUah, Chowringhee, &c. (now
on their way to England per " Burrumpooter "), rushed upon
it — it was the July number, with my paper, which you may
remember made such a sensation — even more eagerly than

(never breaking the incognito) regarding the influence of
JPunch in our vast Indian territories. They say that fiom
Cape Comorin to the Sutlej, and from the Sutlej to tiie
borders of Thibet, nothing is talked of but launch, Doet
Mahommed never misses a single number ; and the Thaia-
waddie knows the figure of Lord Brougham and his Scotch
trousers as well as that of his favorite vizier. I^unehy my
informant states, has rendered his lordship so popular
throughout our Eastern possessions, that were he to be sent
out to India as Governor, the whole army and people would
shout with joyful recognition. I throw out this for the
consideration of Government at home.

I asked Bucksheesh Pasha (with whom I had the honor
of dining at Cairo) what his august Master thought of
Punch, And at the pyramids — but of these in another
letter. You have here enough to show you how kingly the
diadem, boundless the sway, of Punch is in the East. By
it we are enabled to counterbalance the influence of the
French in Egypt ; by it we are enabled to spread civiliza-
tion over the vast Indian Continent, to soothe the irritated
feelings of the Sikhs, and keep the Burmese in good-humor.
By means of Punch, it has been our privilege to expose the
designs of Russia more effectually than Urquhart ever did,
and to this Sir Stratford Canning can testify. A proud and
noble post is that which you, Sir, hold over the Intellect of
the World ; a tremendous power you exercise ! May you
ever wield it wisely and gently as now ! " Subjectis par-
cere, superbos debellare," be your motto ! I forget whether
I mentioned in my last that I was without funds in quar-
antine at Fort Manuel, Malta, and shall anxiously expect
the favor of a communication from you — poste restante —
at that town.

With assurances of the highest consideration,

CHAPTER III:




The above is a picture of some beautiful windmills near
Athens, not, I believe, depicted by any otber artist, and
which I dare say some people ■will admire because they are
Athenian windmills. The world is made so.

I was not a brilliant boy at schnol — the only prize I
ever remember to have got was in a kind of lottery in
which I was obliged to subscribe with seventeen other com-
petitors — and of which the prize was a flogging. That I
won. But I don't think I carried off any other. Possibly
from laziness, or if you please from incapacity, but I cer-
tainly was rather inclined to be on the side of the dunces —
Sir Walter Scott, it will be recollected, was of the same
species. Many young plants sprouted up round about both
of ua, I dare say, with astonishing rapidity — but they
have gone to seed ere this, or were never worth the cultiva-
tion. Great genius is of slower growth.

I always had my doubts about the classics. When I saw
a brute of a schoolmaster, whose mind was as cross-grained



PUNCH IN THE EAST. 107

as any plough-boy's in Christendom ; whose manners were
those of the most insufferable of Heaven's creatures, the
English snob trying to turn gentleman ; whose lips, when
they were not mouthing Greek or grammar, were yelling
out the most brutal abuse of poor little cowering gentlemen
standing before him : when I saw this kind of man (and the
instructors of our youth are selected very frequently indeed
out of this favored class) and heard him roar out praises of,
and pump himself up into enthusiasm for, certain Greek
poetry, — I say I had my doubts about the genuineness of
the article. A man may well thump you or call you names
because you won't learn — but I never could take to the
proffered delicacy ; the fingers that offered it were so dirty.
Fancy the brutality of a man who began a Greek grammar
with " TVTTTO), I thrash " ! We were aU made to begin it in
that way.

When, then, I came to Athens, and saw that it was a
humbug, I hailed the fact with a sort of gloomy joy. I
stood in the Eoyal Square and cursed the country which
has made thousands of little boys miserable. They have
blue stripes on the new Greek flag ; I thought bitterly of
my own. I wished that my schoolmaster had been in the
place, that we might have fought there for the right ; and
that I might have immolated him as a sacrifice to the manes
of little boys flogged into premature Hades, or pining
away and sickening under the destiny of that infernal Greek
grammar. I have often thought that those little cherubs
who are carved on tombstones and are represented as pos-
sessing a head and wings only, are designed to console little
children — usher- and beadle-belabored — and say " there is
no flogging where we are." From their conformation, it is
impossible. Woe to the man who has harshly treated one
of them !

Of the ancient buildings in this beggarly town it is not
my business to speak. Between ourselves it must be ac-
knowledged that there was some merit in the Heathens
who constructed them. But of the Temple of Jupiter, of
which some columns still remain, I declare with confidence
that not one of them is taller than our own glorious Mon-
ument on Fish-Street Hill, which I heartily wish to see
again, whereas upon the columns of Jupiter I never more
desire to set eyes. On the Acropolis and its temples and
towers I shall also touch briefly. The frieze of the Parthe-



108 PAPERS BY THE FAT CONTRIBUTOR.

non is well known in England, tlie famous chevavx-de-frise
being carried off by Lord Elgin, and now in the British
Museum, Great Eussell Street, Bloomsbury. The Erech-
theum is another building, which I suppose has taken its
name from the genteel club in London at a comer of Saint
James's Square. It is likewise called the Temple of
Minerva Polias — a capital name for ^ club in London
certainly ; fancy gentlemen writing on their cards " Mr.
Jones, Temple-of-Minerva-Polias Club.'' — Our country is
surely the most classical of islands.

As for the architecture of that temple, if it be not entirely
stolen from Saint Pancras Chui-ch, New Road, or vice versa,
I am a Dutchman. " The Tower of the Winds " may be
seen any day at Edinburgh — and the Lantern of Demos-
thenes is at this very minute perched on the top of the
church in Regent Street, within a hundred yards of the lan-
tern of Mr. Drummond. Only in London you have them
all in much better preservation — the noses of the New
Road caryatides are not broken as those of their sisters
here. The Temple of the Scotch Winds I am pleased to
say I have never seen, but I have no doubt it is worthy of
the Modem Athens — and as for the choragic temple of
Lysicrates, erroneously called Demosthenes's Lantern —
from Waterloo Place you can see it well : whereas here it is
a ruin in the midst of a huddle of dirty huts, whence you
try in vain to get a good view of it.

When I say of the Temple of Theseus (quoting Murray's
Guide-book) that " it is a peripteral hexastyle with a pro-
naos, a posticum, and two columns between the antae," the
commonest capacity may perfectly imagine the place.
Fancy it upon an irregular ground of copper-colored herb-
age, with black goats feeding on it, and the sound of per-
petual donkeys braying round about. Fancy to the south-
east the purple rocks and towers of the Acropolis meeting
the eye — to the southeast the hilly islands and the blue
-^gean. Fancy the cobalt sky above, and the temple itself
(built of Pentelic marble) of the exact color and mouldiness
of a ripe Stilton cheese, and you have the view before you
as well as if you had been there.

As for the modern buildings — here is a beautiful design
of the Royal Palace,

The Chambers were about to sit when we arrived. The

the steward who remonstrated with him on the irregularity.
It is quite needless to say that he kept his place — and as
the honorable deputy could not read, of course he could
not be expected to understand the regulations imposed by
the avaricious proprietors of the boat in question. Happy
is the country to have such makers of laws, and to enjoy
the liberty consequent upon the representative system !

take a lesson from it — they charge five shillings sterling

which I never could calculate) for a bed in a double-bedded
room ; and our poor young friend Scratchley, with whom I
was travelling, was compelled to leave his and sit for safety
on a chair, on a table in the middle of the room.

As for me — but I will not relate my own paltry suffer-
ings. The post goes out in half-an-hour, and I had thought
ere its departure to have described to you Constantinople
and my interview with the Sultan there — his splendid of-
fers — the Princess Badroulbadour, the order of the Nisham,
the Pashalic with three tails — and my firm but indignant
rejection. I had thought to describe Cairo — interview
with Mehemet Ali — proposals of that Prince — splendid
feast at the house of my dear friend Bucksheesh Pasha,
dancing-girls and magicians after dinner, and their extraor-
dinary disclosures ! But I should fill volumes at this rate ;
and I can't, like Mr. James, write a volume between break-
fast and luncheon.

I have only time rapidly to jot down my great adyen-
TTJRE AT THE PYRAMIDS — and Punch^s cnthronization

CHAPTER IV.



PUNCH AT THE PYRAMIDS.



The 19th day of October, 1844 (the seventh day of the
month Hudjmudj, and the 1229th year of the Mohammedan
Hejira, corresponding with the 16,769th anniversary of the
48th incarnation of Veeshnoo), is a day that ought hereaf-
ter to be considered eternally famous in the climes of the
East and West. I forget wnat was the day of General Bo-
naparte's battle of the Pyramids; I thiii it was in the
month Quintidi of the year Nivose of the French Republic^
and he told his soldiers that forty centuries looked down
upon them from the summit of those buildings — a state-
ment which I very much doubt. But I say the 19th day
OF October, 1844, is the most important era in the modem
world's history. It unites the modern with the ancient
civilization; it couples the brethren of Watt and Cobden
with the dusky family of Pharaoh and Sesostris ; it fuses
Herodotus with Thomas Babington Macaulay; it inter-
twines the piston of the blond Anglo-Saxon steam-engine
with the needle of the Abyssinian Cleopatra ; it weds the
tunnel of the subaqueous Brunei with the mystic edifice of
Cheops. Strange play of wayward fancy I Ascending the
Pyramid, I could not but think of Waterloo Bridge in my
dear native London — a building as vast and as magnificent,
as beautiful, as useless, and as lonely. Forty centuries
have not as yet passed over the latter structure 'tis true ;
scarcely an equal number of hackney-coaches have crossed
it. But I doubt whether the individuals who contributed
to raise it are likely to receive a better dividend for their
capital than the swarthy shareholders in the Pyramid spec-
ulation, whose dust has long since been trampled over by
countless generations of their sons.

If I use in the above sentence the longest words I can
find, it is because the occasion is great and demands the fin-
est phrases the dictionary can supply ; it is because I have
not read Tom Macaulay in vain ; it is because I wish to

show I am a dab in history, as the above dates will testify ;
it is because I have seen the Eeverend Mr. Milman preach
in a blaxjk gown at Saint Margaret's, whereas at the Corona-
tion he wore a gold cope. The 19th of October was Punches
Coronation; I officiated at the august ceremony. To be
brief — as illiterate readers may not understand a syllable
of the above piece of ornamental eloquence — on the 19th
OF October, 1844, I pasted the gbeat placabd of
Punch on the Pyramid of Cheops. I did it. The Fat
Contributor did it. If I die, it could not be undone. If I
perish, I have not lived in vain.

If the forty centuries are on the summit of the Pyra-
mids, as Bonaparte remarks, all I can say is, / did not see
them. But Punch has really been there ; this I swear.
One placard I pasted on the first-landing-place (who knows
how long Arab rapacity will respect the sacred hiero-
glyphic ?) One I placed under a great stone on the sum-
mit ; one I waved in the air, as my Ai*abs raised a mighty
cheer round the peaceful victorious banner ; and I flung it
towards the sky, which the Pyramid almost touches, and
left it to its fate, to mount into the azure vault and take
its place among the constellations ; to light on the eternal
Desert, and mingle with its golden sands ; or to flutter
and drop into the purple waters of the neighboring Nile,
to swell its fructifying inundations, and mingle with the
rich vivifying influence which shoots into the tall palm-
trees on its banks, and generates the waving corn.

I wonder were there any signs or omens in London when
that event occurred ? Did an earthquake take place ? Did
Stocks or the Barometer pretematurally rise or fall ? It
matters little. Let it suffice that the thing has been done,
and forms an event in History by the side of those other
facts to which these prodigious monuments bear testimony.
Now to narrate briefly the circumstances of the day.

On Thursday, October 17, 1 caused my dragoman to pur-
chase in the Prank bazaar at Grand Cairo the following
articles, which will be placed in the Museum on my re-
turn : —

A is a tin pot holding about a pint, and to contain B, a
packet of flour (which of course is not visible, as it is tied
up in brown paper), and C, a pigskin brush of the sort com-
monly used in Europe — the whole costing about five pias-
tres, or one shilling sterling. They were all the imple-
ments needful for this tremendous undertaking.



PUNCH IN THE EAST.




Horses of the Mosaic Arab breed — I mean those animals
called Jerusalem ponies by some in England, by others de-
nominated donkeys — are the common means of transport
employed by the subjects of Mehemet Alt My excellent
friend Bucksheesh Pasha would have mounted me either on
his favorite horse, or his best dromedary. But I declined
those proffers — if I fall, I like better to fall from a short
distance than a high one. — I have tried tumbling in both
ways, and recommend the former as by far the pleasantest
and safest. I chose the Mosaic Arab then — one for the
dragoman, one for the requisites of refreshment, and two
for myself — not that I proposed to ride two at once, but a
person of a certain dimension had best have a couple of
animals in case of accident.

I left Cairo on the afternoon of October 18, never hinting
to a single person the mighty purpose of my journey. The
waters were out, and we had to cross them thrice — twice
in track-boats, once on the shoulders of abominable Arabs,
who take a pleasure in slipping and in making believe to
plunge you in the stream. When in the midst of it, the
brutes atop and demand money of you — you are alarmed,
the savages may drop you if you do not give — you promise
that you will do so. The half-naked ruffians who conduct
you up the Pyramid, when they have got you panting to the
most steep, dnngerous, and lonely stone, make the same de-
mand, pointing downwards while they beg, as if they would
fling you in that direction on refusal. As soon as you have
breath, you promise more money — it is the best way — you
are a fool if you give it when you come down.

The journey I find briefly set down in my pocket-book as
thus : — Cairo Gardens — Mosquitoes — Women dressed in
blue — Children dressed in nothing — Old Cairo — Nile,
dirty water, ferry-boat — Town — Palm-trees, ferry-boat,

canal, palin-trees, town — Rice fields — Maize fields — Fel-
lows on dromedaries — Donkey down — Over his head —
Pick up pieces — More palm-trees — More rice fields —
Water-courses — Howling Arabs — Donkey tumbles down
again — Inundations — Herons or cranes — Broken bridges
— Sands — Pyramids. If a man cannot make a landscape
out of tJiat he has no imagination. Let him paint the skies
very blue — the sands very yellow — the plains very flat
and green — the dromedaries and palm-trees very tall — the
women very brown, some with veils, some with nose-rings,
some tattooed, and none with stays — and the picture is
complete. You may shut your eyes and fancy yourself
there. It is the pleasantest way, entre nous.

CHAPTER V.

PUNCH AT THE PYRAMIDS (couclvded).

It is all very well to talk of sleeping in the tombs : that
question has been settled in a former paper, where I have
stated my belief that people do not sleep at all in Egypt.
I thought to have had some tremendous visions under the
shadow of those enormous Pyramids reposing under the
stars. Pharaoh or Cleopatra, I thought, might appear to
me in a dream. But how could they, as I didn't go to
sleep ? I hoped for high thoughts, and secret communings
with the Spirit of Poesy — I hoped to have let off a sonnet
at least, as gentlemen do on visiting the spot — but how
could I hunt for rhymes, being occupied all night in hunt-
ing for something else ? If this remonstrance will deter a
single person from going to the Pyramids, my purpose is
fuUy answered.

But my case was different. I had a duty to perform — I
had to introduce Punch to Cheops — I had vowed to leave
his card at the gates of History — I had a mission, in a
word. I roused at sunrise the snoring dragoman from his
lair. I summoned the four Arabs who had engaged to as-
sist me in the ascent, and in the undertaking. We lighted
a fire of camels' dung at the northeast corner of the Pyra-
mid, just as the god of day rose over Cairo. The embers
began to glow, — water was put into the tin pot before men-
tioned, — the pot was put on the fire — 'twas a glorious —
a thrilling moment !

At 46 minutes past 6 A. m. (by one of DoUond's chro-
nometers) the water began to boil.

At 47 minutes the flour was put gradually into the water
— it was stirred with the butt-end of the brush brought for
the purpose, and Schmaklek Beg, an Arab, peeping over the
pot too curiously, I poked the brush into his mouth at 11
minutes before 7 a. m.

At 7, the paste was made — doubting whether it was
thick enough, Schmaklek tried it with his finger. It was
pronomiced to be satisfactory.



116 PAPERS BY THE FAT CONTRIBUTOR.

At 11 minutes past 7, I turned round in a majestic
attitude to the four Arabs, and said, " Let us mount." I
suggest this scene, this moment, this attitude, to the com-
mittee of the Fine Arts as a proper subject for the Houses
of Parliament — Punch pointing to the Pyramids, and in-
troducing civilization to Egypt — I merely throw it out as a
suggestion. What a grand thing the Messieurs Foggo
would make of it !

Having given the signal — the Sheikh of the Arabs
seized my right arm, and his brother the left. Two volun-
teer Arabs pushed me (quite unnecessarily) behind. The
other two preceded — one with a water-bottle for refresh-
ment ; the other with the posters — the pot — the paint-
brush and the paste. Away we went — away !

I was blown at the third step. They are exceedingly
lofty ; about five feet high each, I should think — but the
ardent spirit will break his heart to win the goal — besides,
I could not go back if I would. The two Arabs dragged
me forward by the arms — the volunteers pushed me up
from behind. It was in vain I remonstrated with the latter,
kicking violently as occasion offered — they still went on
pushing. We arrived at the first landing-place.

I drew out the poster — how it fluttered in the breeze !

— With a trembling hand I popped the brush into the paste-
pot, and smeared the back of the placard ; then I pasted up
the standard of our glorious leader — at 19 minutes past 7,
by the clock of the great minaret at Cairo, which was
clearly visible through my refracting telescope. My heart
throbbed when the deed was done. My eyes filled with
tears — I am not at liberty to state here all the emotions of
triumph and joy which rose in my bosom — so exquisitely
overpowering were they. There was Punch — familiar old
Punch — his back to the desert, his beaming face turned
towards the Nile.

" Bless him ! " I exclaimed, embracing him ; and almost
choking, gave the signal to the Arabs to move on.

" These savage creatures are only too ready to obey an
order of this nature. They spin a man along, be his size
never so considerable. They rattled up to the second land-
ing so swiftly that I thought I should be broken-winded
for ever. But they gave us little time to halt. Yallah !
Again we mount ! — 'tis the last and most arduous ascent

— the limbs quiver, the pulses beat, the eyes shoot out of
the head, the brain reels, the knees tremble and totter, and

you axe on the summit I I don't know how many hundred
thousand feet it is above the level of the sea, but I wonder
after that tremendous exercise that I am not a roarer to my
dying hour.

"Wien consciousness and lungs regained their play, an-
other copy of the placard was placed under a stone — a
third was launched into air in the manner before described,
and we gave three immense cheers for Punch, which aston-
ished the undiscovered mummies that lie darkling in tomb-
chambers, and must have disturbed the broken-nosed old
Sphinx who has been couched for thousands of years in the
desert hard by. This done, we made our descent from the
Pyramid.

And if, my dear Sir, you ask me whether it is worth a
man's while to mount up those enormous stones, I will
say, in confidence, that thousands of people went to see the
Bottle Conjurer, and that we hear of gentlemen becoming
Freemasons every day.

US;



|i| AVE tie kindness, my dear Pugsby,
to despatch me a line when they
have done painting the smoking-
room at the Megatherium, that I
may come back to town. After
suffering as we have all the year,
not so much from the bad ventila-
tion of the room, ae from the suf-
focating dulness ofWheezer, Snoo-
zer, and WhifHer, who frequent it,
I had hoped for quiet by the sea-
shore hei-e, and that our three
abominable acquaintances had
quitted England.
I had scai'cely been ten minutes
in the place, my ever-dear Pugsby, when 1 met old Snoozer
walking with young De Bosky, of the Tatters-and-Starva^
tion Club, on the opposite side of our square, and ogling
the girls on the Cliff, the old wretch, as if he had not a
wife and a half-a-dozen daughters of his own in Poekling-
ton Square. He hooked on to my arm as if he had been
the Old Man of the Sea, and I found myself introduced to
young De Bosky, a man whom I have carefully avoided as
an odious and disreputable tiger, the tuft on whose chin
has been always particulai-ly disagreeable to me, and who
is besides a Captain, or Commodore, or some such thing,
in the Bundelcund Cavalry. The clink and glitter of his
spui'S is perfectly abominable : he is screwed so tight in his
waistband that I wish it could render him speechless (for
when he does speak he is so stupid that he sends you to
sleep while actually walking with him) ; and as for his
chest, which he bulges out against the shoulders of all the



BRIGHTON IN 1847, 119

passers-by, I am sure that he carries a part of his wardrobe
in it, and that he is wadded with stockings and linen as if
he were a walking carpet-bag.

This fellow saluted two-thirds of the carriages which
passed with a knowing nod, and a military swagger so ar-
rogant, that I feel continually the greatest desire to throttle
him.

Well, sir, before we had got from the Tepid Swimming
Bath to Mutton's the pastrycook's, whom should we meet
but Wheezer, to be sure. Wheezer driving up and down
the Cliff at half-a-crown an hour, with his hideous family,
Mrs. Wheezer, the Miss Wheezers in fur tippets and drawn
bonnets with spring-flowers in them, a huddle and squeeze
of little Wheezers sprawling and struggling on the back
seat of the carriage, and that horrible boy whom Wheezer
brings to the Club sometimes, actually seated on the box of
the fly, and ready to drive, if the coachman should be in-
toxicated or inclined to relinquish his duty.

Wheezer sprang out of the vehicle with a cordiality that
made me shudder. " Hullo, my boy ! " said he, seizing my
trembling hand. " What ! you here ? Hang me if the
whole Club isn't here. I'm at 56 Horse Marine Parade.
Where are you lodging ? We're out for a holiday, and will
make a jolly time of it.'*

The benighted, the conceited old wretch ! He would not
let go my hand until I told him where I resided — at Mrs.
Muggeridge's in Black Lion Street, where I have a tolerable
view of the sea, if I risk the loss of my equilibrium and the
breakage of my back, by stretching three-quarters of my
body out of my drawing-room window.

As he stopped to speak to me, his carriage of course
stopped likewise, forcing all the vehicles in front and be-
hind him to halt or to precipitate themselves over the rail-
ings on to the shingles and the sea. The cabs, the flys,
the shandrydans, the sedan-chairs with the poor old inva-
lids inside ; the old maids', the dowagers' chariots, out of
which you see countenances scarcely less deathlike ; the
stupendous cabs, out of which the whiskered heroes of the
gallant Onety-oneth look down on us people on foot ; the
hacks mounted by young ladies from the equestrian schools,
by whose sides the riding-masters canter confidentially —
everybody stopped. There was a perfect strangury in the
street; and I should have liked not only to throttle De
Bosky, but to massacre Wheezer, too.

The wretched though unconscious being insisted on nail-
ing me for dinner before he would leave me ; and I heard
him say (that is, by the expression of his countenance, and
the glances which his wife and children cast at me, I knew
he said), " That is the young and dashing Folkstone Canter-
bury, the celebrated contributor to Funch,^^

The crowd, sir, on the Cliff was perfectly frightful. It is
my belief nobody goes abroad any more. Everybody is at
Brighton. I met three hundred at least of our acquaint-
ances in the course of a quarter of an hour, and before we
could reach Brunswick Square I met dandies. City men,
Members of Parliament. I met my tailor walking with his
wife, with a geranium blooming in his wretched button-
hole, as if money wasn't tight in the City, and everybody
had paid him everything everybody owed him. I turned
and sickened at the sight of that man. " Snoozer," said I,
" I will go on the Pier."

I went, and to find what ? — Whiffler, by all that is un-
merciful ! — Whiffler, whom we see every day, in the same
chair, at the Megatherium. Whiffler, whom not to see is to
make all the good fellows at the Club happy. I have seen
him every day, and many times a day since. At the mo-
ment of our first rencontre I was so saisiy so utterly over-
come by rage and despair, that I would have flung myself
into the azure waves sparkling calmly around me, but for
the chains of the Pier.

I did not take that aqueous suicidal plunge — I resolved
to live, and why, my dear Pugsby ? Who do you think ap-
proached us ? Were you not at one of his parties last sea-
son ? I have polked in his saloons. I have nestled under
the mahogany of his dining-room, at least one hundred and
twenty thousand times. It was Mr. Goldmore, the East
India Director, with Mrs. G-. on his arm, and — oh, heav-
ens ! — Florence and Violet Goldmore, with pink parasols,
walking behind their parents.

" What ! you here ! ^^ said the good and hospitable man,
holding out his hand, and giving a slap on the boards (or
deck, I may say) with his bamboo ; " hang it, everyone's
here. Come and dine at seven. Brunswick Square."

I looked in Violet's eyes. Florence is rather an old
bird, and wears spectacles, so that looking in her eyes is
out of the question. I looked in Violet's eyes, and said I'd
come with the greatest pleasure.

" As for you, De Bosky " — (I forget whether I men-



BRIGHTON IN ISJft, 121

tioned that the whiskered Bundelcund buck had come with
me on to the Pier, whither Snoozer would not follow us,
declining to pay the twopence) — "as for you^ De Bosky,
you may come, or not, as you like."

" Won't 1,'^ said he, grinning, with a dandified Bundel-
cund nod, and wagging his odious head.

I could have wrenched it off and flung it in the ocean.
But I restrained my propensity, and we agreed that, for the
sake of economy, we would go to Mr. Goldmore's in the
same fly.

CHAPTER II.

HE very first spoon-
ful of the clear soup
at the Director's
told me that my ex-
cellent friend Parar
dol (the chef who
came to Mr. Gold-
more, Portland
Place, when Guttle-
luiy House was
shut up by the la-
mented levanting of
the noble Earl) waa
established among
the furnaces below.
A clear brown soup
— none of your
filthy, spiced, Eng-
lish hell-broths, but
hght brisk, and del-
icate — always sets
me oft for the even-
ii^ : it invigorates and enlivens me, my dear Pugsby : I
give you my honor it does — and when I am in a good
humor, I am, I flatter myself — what shall I say ? — well,
not disagreeable.

On this day, sir, I was delightful. Although that booby
De Bosky conducted Miss Violet Goldmore downstairs, yet
the wretch, absorbed in his victuals, and naturally of an
unutterable dulness, did not make a single remark during
dinner, whereas I literally blazed with wit. Sir, I even
made one of the footmen laugh — a perilous joke for the
poor fellow, who, I dare say, will be turned off in conse-
quence. I talked sentiment to Florence (women in spec-
tacles are almost always sentimental) ; cookery to Sir Har-
court Gulph, who particularly asked my address, and I have

no doubt intends to invite me to his dinners in town ; mili-
tary affairs with Major Bangles of the Onety-oneth Hus-
sars, who was with the regiment at Aliwal and Ferozeshah,
and drives about a prodigious cab at Brighton, with a cap-
tured Sikh behind, disguised as a tiger ; to Mrs. Goldmore
I abused Lady Toddle-Eowdy's new carriages and absurd
appearance (she is seventy-four if she is a day, and she
wears a white muslin frock and frilled trousers, with a wig
curling down her old back, and I do believe puts on a pin-
afore, and has a little knife and fork and silver mug at
home, so girlish is she) : I say, in a word — and I believe
without fear of contradiction — that I delighted everybody.

" Delightful man ! " said Mrs. Bangles to my excellent
friend, Mrs. Goldmore.

" Extraordinary creature ; so odd, isn't he ? " replied that
admirable woman.

" What a flow of spirits he has ! " cried the charming
Violet.

" And yet sorrows repose under that smiling mask, and
those outbreaks of laughter perhaps conceal the groans of
smouldering passion and the shrieks of withering despair,"
sighed Florence. " It is always so : the wretched seem to
be most joyous. If I didn't think that man miserable, I
couldn't be happy," she added, and lapsed into silence.
Little Mrs. Diggs told me every word of the conversation,
when I came up, the first of the gentlemen, to tea.

" Clever fellow that," said (as I am given to understand)
Sir Harcourt Gulph. "I liked that notion of his about
croquignoles a la pouffarde : I will speak to Moufflon to try
it"

" I really shall mention in the Bank parlor to-morrow,"
the Director remarked, "what he said about the present
crisis, and his project for a cast-iron currency : that man is
by no means the trifler he pretends to be."

" Where did he serve ? " asked Bangles. " If he can
manoeuvre an army as well as he talks about it, demmy, he
ought to be Commander-in-Chief. Did you hear, Captain
de Bosky, what he said about pontooning the Echelons, and
operating with our reserve upon the right bank of the river
at Ferozeshah ? Gad, sir, if that manoeuvre had been per-
formed, not a man of the Sikh army would have escaped : "
— in which case of course Major Bangles would have lost
the black tiger behind his cab ; but De Bosky did not make
this remark. The great stupid hulking wretch remarked

notliing ; he gorged himself with meat and wine, and when
quite replete with claret, strutted up to the drawing-room, to
show his chest and his white waistcoat there.

I was pouring into Violet's ear (to the discomfiture of
Florence who was knocking about the tea-things madly)
some of those delightful nothings with which a weU-bred
man in society entertains a female. I spoke to her about
the last balls in London — about Fanny Finch's elopement
with Tom Parrot, who had nothing but his place in the
Foreign Office — about the people who were at Brighton —
about Mr. Midge's delightful sermon at church last Sun-
day — about the last fashions, and the next — que sais-je ?
— when that brute De Bosky swaggered up.

" Ah, hum, haw," said he, " were you out raiding to-day.
Miss Goldmaw ? "

Determined to crush this odious and impertinent blun-
derer, who has no more wit than the horses he bestrides, I
resolved to meet him on his own ground, and to beat him
even on the subject of horses.

I am sorry to say, my dear Pugsby, I did not confine my-
self strictly to truth : but I described how I had passed
three months in the Desert with an Arab tribe ; how I had
a mare, during that period, descended from Boorawk, the
mare of the Prophet, which I afterwards sold for 50,000
piastres to Mahomet Ali ; and how, being at Trebizond,
smoking with the sanguinary Pasha of that place, I had
bitted, saddled, and broke to carry a lady, a gray Turkoman
horse of his which had killed fourteen of his grooms, and
bit off the nose of his Kislar Aga.

" Do join us in our ride to-morrow," cried Violet ; " the
Downs are delightful."

" Fairest lady, to hear is to obey," answered I, with a
triumphant glance at De Bosky. I had done his business,
at any rate.

Well, sir, I came at two o'clock, mounted on one of Jig-
got's hacks — an animal that I know, and that goes as easy
as a sedan-chair — and found the party assembling before
the Director's house, in Brunswick Square. There was
young Goldmore — the lovely Violet, in a habit that showed
her form to admiration, and a perfectly ravishing Spanish
tuft in her riding-hat, with a little gold whip and a little
pair of gauntlets — a croquer, in a word. Major Bangles
and lady were also of the party : in fact, we were " a gal-
lant company of cavaliers," as James says in his novels \



BRIGHTON IN 1847. 125

and with my heels well down, and one of my elbows stuck
out, I looked, sir, like the Marquis of Anglesea. I had the
honor of holding Violet's little foot in my hand, as she
jumped into her saddle. She sprang into it like a fairy.

Last of all, the stupid De Bosky came up. He came up
moaning and groaning. " I have had a kick in the back
from a horse in the livery-stables," says he ; "I can't hold
this horse — will you ride him, Canterbury ? " His horse
was a black, wicked-looking beast as ever I saw, with blood-
shot eyes and a demoniacal expression.

What could I do after the stories about Boorawk and the
Pasha of Trebizond ? Sir, I was obliged to get off my se-
dan-chair, and mount the Captain's Purgatory, as I call him

— a disgusting brute, and worthy of his master.

Well, sir, off we set, — Purgatory jumping from this
side of the road to t'other, shying at Miss Pogson, who
passed in her carriage (as well he might at so hideous a
phenomenon) — plunging at an apple-woman and stall —
going so wild at a baker's cart that I thought he would have
jumped into the hall-door where the man was delivering a
pie for dinner — and flinging his head backwards, so as to
endanger my own nose every moment. It was all I could
do to keep him in. I tugged at both bridles till I tore his
jaws into a fury, I suppose.

Just as we were passing under the viaduct, whirr came
the steaming train with a bang, and a shriek, and a whizz.
The brute would hold in no longer : he ran away with me.

I stuck my feet tight down in the stirrups, and thought
of my mother with inexpressible agony. I clutched hold of
all the reins and a great deal of the mane of the brute. I
saw trees, milestones, houses, villages, pass away from me

— away, away, away — away by the cornfields — away by
the wolds — away by the eternal hills — away by the woods
and precipices — the woods, the rocks, the villages flashed
by me. Oh, Pugsby ! how I longed for the Megatherium
during that ride !

It lasted, as it seemed to me, about nine hours, during
which I went over, as I should think, about 540 miles of
ground. I didn't come off — my hat did, a new Lincoln
and Bennett, but I didn't — and at length the infuriate
brute paused in his mad career, with an instinctive respect
for the law, at a turnpike gate. I little knew the blessing
of a turnpike until then.

In a minute Bangles came up, bursting with laughter.

" You can't manage that horse, I think," said the Major,
with his infernal good-nature. " Shall I ride him ? Mine
is a quiet beast."

I was off Purgatory's back in a minute, and as I mounted
on Bangles's hackney, felt as if I was getting into bed, so
easy, so soft, so downy he seemed to me.

He said, though I never can believe it, that we had only
come about a mile and a half ; and at this moment the two
ladies and De Bosky rode up.

" Is that the way you broke the Pasha of Trebizond's
horse ? " Violet said. I gave a laugh ; but it was one of
despair. I should have liked to plunge a dagger in De
Bosky's side.

I shall come to town directly, I think. This Brighton
is a miserable Cockney place.

MEDITATIONS ON SOLITUDE.

UB drawing-room at the Regent is a
desert. You can't get a rubber of
whist in the evening, for the card-
players aie all gone. Puffins is the
only man left in the smoking-room,
. and he is such a bore, that solitude
is pleasant compared to his fright-
ful conversation. All the house-
carpets are up, and the place in-
fested with abominable scourers,
gilders, and whitewaahers. The
house-steward is out of town : the
French cook has got leave of ab-
sence, and I believe the hall porter has gone to the Moora.
It is September in a word, and I am alone and deserted.

All the familiar places where you get dinner during the
season are shut up. They are painting Hobanob's house.
Carver's shutters are closed in Portland Place, and the par-
lor-blinds are pinned up with newspapers. I wonder
whether the Bogles like frying at Naples as well as their
cool pleasant house in Hyde Park Terra^se ? What capital
34 Claret that was of Bogle's ; that last batch from Car-
bonel'a, I mean. Dear Emily Bogle ! I thought there was a
tear in her eye as I led her down to the cai'iii^e at Lady
Kiekaey's, and said farewell. I wish to Heaven Bogle
would come back. Not so much about Emily; but his
cook makes the best white-soup in England.
Why the deuce did not Sir John Kicksey ask me down

to Kicksey Acres. I gave him hints enough. I told him I
could not go abroad this autumn — that I thought of going
to shoot in his neighborhood at old Hawcock's. I told the
old brute as much three times, and he always turned the
conversation. Does he fancy there is anything serious be-
tween me and Eliza ? Psha ! I can't marry twelve thou-
sand pound. The girl was rather sweet on me, I confess.
But her mother is bent upon marrying her to a title ; and
the way in which she is manoeuvring poor little Tufto
makes all London laugh.

Out of the six red-coated villains who used to hold youi
horse opposite the palace in St. James's Street (the claret
at the guards' mess has been remarkably good this year,
and I warrant you there's no stint), only two are left. I
asked where the head of the gang was — the squinting one.
He is gone abroad, upon my conscience ! To Baden-Baden,
or the Pyrenees, no doubt.

The number of men growing mustachios during the last
two weeks of August was quite facetious. Snuffy upper lips
met you everywhere. I met Swinney, the artist — snuffy
upper lip ; his hair is of a light hue, and the incipient
whisker looked like a smear of Welsh High-dried. He
was going up the Ehine, he told me, and blushed as I
sneeringly pointed to the ornament beginning to decorate
his jolly face. I met Quackle, the barrister — snuffy upper
lip. He has made nine or ten thousand in the committees
this year, and is off for three weeks' pleasuring. I warrant
he didn't blush when I alluded to the black stubble sprout-
ing under his beak of a nose. Quackle blush, indeed ! I
went into Bulter and Vogel's, my tailors, in Clifford Street
— snuffy upper lip again; not Bulter's, who is a family
man, and has his villa at Eoehampton ; but Vogel's mus-
tache bids fair to be as long as that of Timour the Tartar.
He has a right to the whiskers, however, being a tailor, and
a count of the empire.

But the best of the mustachios that I have heard of is
that of old Wapshot, our tutor at Oxford, who was detected
in Belgium, whiskered, in a green-frogged coat, and calling
himself Colonel Waldemar.

If our people are invading the Continent in great force,
on the other hand, the influx of Frenchmen hitherwards is
prodigious. I never saw so many of the little smug, self-
satisfied, high-heeled, narrow-ribbed, be-stayed, be-whis-
kered, be-curling-ironed, under-sized generation. They are



MEDITATIONS ON SOLITUDE. 129

jabbering about every Qorner of Leicester Square and
Regent Street*; and you see the little rickety creatures
peering in at the empty club-house doors, or chaffering with
cabmen for their fares.

I saw two of them standing on Eichmond Hill the other
day, and patronizing it. C'estjoli, says one; c^ est pas mal,
says the other ; as if, now they had given their opinion, the
view might pass muster. And then one of the little dwai'fs
curled his waxed moustache, and leered at Mrs. Blobby's
handsome nursery-maid, who was passing with about eleven
of B.'s youngest children.

It can't be helped. Do what you will, you can't respect
Frenchmen. It's well of us to talk equality and amity.
But we can't keep up the farce of equality with them at all.
And my opinion is, that the reason why they hate us, and
will hate us, and ought to hate us forever, is the conscious-
ness of this truth on one side or the other. It is not only
in history and in battles, but we are domineering over them
in every table d ^hote in Europe at this moment. We go into
their own houses, and bully them there. We can't be
brought to believe that a Frenchman is equal to an English-
man. Is there any man in England who thinks so in his
heart ? If so, let him send his name to the publishers.

This huge desert of a London is abominable. Every-
body is gone ! Everybody. It's heart-breaking to pass from
house to house, and think glasses are covered, the carpets
are up, the jolly Turkish-rug gone from under the hospi-
table mahogany, 'neath which your legs have reposed so
often, and the only inhabitant of the mansion a snuffy char-
woman. How to pass your evenings ? In theatres — to
see clumsy translations from the French — to see vulgarized
multiplications of Mrs. Caudle. The passion for the Stage
is like the love of gooseberry-fool — strongest in youth.
The only thing in the dramatic art which has survived early
youth in my love is Widdicombe, and he is always new.
But you cannot do Widdicombe more than six times in a
season.

I co\ild not leave town or its neighborhood, being (be-
tween ourselves) chairman of the Diddlesex Junction ; and
exceedingly anxious about the Great Pedlington line (with
a branch to Muffborough and Stagg's End). And the above
observations were written in the deepest despondency, as I
Bat at dessert, alone, in the enormous coffee-room of the



130 PAPERS BY PUNCH'S COMMISSIONER,

Kegent Club : when, suddenly, the bright idea rose to my
mind — if London is empty, why not go to the watering-
places ? Have you ever been at Bagnigge Wells, you who
know Baden so well ? Have you ever beheld the Pyramids
(ille ego qui qtwndam, etc.), ever glanced at Rosherville Gar-
dens ? Tivoli is a very nice place ; but what do you say,
my lad, to Tunbridge ? You who have seen the caverns of
Posilipo, say, have you beheld the Swiss Cottage and Grotto,
Shoreham, near Brighton ? Go out and be a Commissioner
for Punch at the watering-places of this great kingdom. —
And my soul was refreshed at the thought, and I knew the
first moment of happiness I have enjoyed (for the Diddle-
sex Junctions are somehow low in the market) since the
end of the term.



BEULAH SPA. 131



BEULAH SPA.

THE nearest Wells, except those of Sadler or Bagnigge
(which are too near to Pentonville and Islington to
require description for Londoners), are, I believe, those
comparatively modern Spas of Beulah, situated among the
pleasant hills of Norwood, and to be reached by a person
inhabiting the western end of the metropolis with not too
much exertion.

Determined to examine these Wells, and averse to soli-
tary travel, I put myself in communication with my young
friend. Lieutenant Rawbold, of the 75th Lancers — select-
ing that young fellow, not on account of his conversational
powers, which are small ; but rather because he possesses
an exceedingly well-regulated cab and horse, or, as he says
(in his clever facetious way), " the most hactionest hoss and
the most himpidintest tiger in the village of Limding." In
this vehicle we made our way to the Spa in question.

The purlieus of London are not to be described. The
mind sickens in recalling the odious particulars of the im-
mediate neighborhood of the bridges. The hucksters and
Jew furniture-shops, the enormous tawdry gin-palaces, and
those awful little by-lanes, of two-storied tenements, where
patent mangles are to let — where Miss Mifl&n, milliner,
lives on the first floor (her trade being symbolized by a
staring pasteboard dummy in a cap of fly-blown silver
paper) — where the street is encumbered by oyster-shells
and black puddles, and little children playing in them. All
these we passed : likewise grim-looking Methodist chapels,
and schools, churches, and asylums innumerable. But the
road has possibly been travelled by my indulgent readers.

I perceived that the persons at the turnpikes were face-
tiously inclined. A species of jokes passed between them
and Augustus Frederic, Eawbold's groom, who was clinging
on behind like a spread-eagle.



132 PAPERS BY PUNCIPS COMMISSIONER.

You emerge from the horrid road at length on a greenish
spot, which I am led to believe is called Kennington Com-
mon ; and henceforward the route becomes far more agree-
able. Placid villas of cockneys adorn each side of the road
— stock-brokers, sugar-bakers, — that sort of people. We
saw cruelty-vans (I mean those odious double-barrelled gigs,
so injurious to horseflesh) lined with stout females, with
ringlets, bustles, and variegated parasols. The leading
stout female of the party drove the carriage, (jerking and
bumping the reins most ludicrously, and giving the fat
horse the queerest little cuts with the whip) ; a fat boy,
resplendent in buttons, commonly occupied the rumble, with
many children: in some cases I remarked that disguised
footboys, habited in a half-coachman's dress, drove the
vehicle. I presumed that Augustus Frederic, our Spread-
Eagle, must have made signs of various kinds to these per-
sons from behind; for I perceived various expressions of
indignation or wonder in the persons' countenances as we
passed their singular equipages.

In this cockney villa district I observed that the country-
was almost tenanted by women. All the people walking
were women, except young stock-brokers in the arms of
nursery-maids ; or occasional pages following young ladies ;
or the doctor's boy ringing at some villa gate ; or the blue-
clad butcherling arriving with the fillet of veaL The men
are absent in enormous, smoking London — 'tis only with
sunset that they come back to their families and the fillet
of veal.

The villas give each other the hand all the way up Cam-
den Hill, Denmark Hill, etc. ; one acacia leans over to
another in his neighbor's wall ; Dobbs's bell-pull runs cheek
by jowl with Hobbs's ; one villa is just like another ; and
there is no intermission in the comfortable chain. But by
the time you reach Norwood, an actual country is to be
viewed by glimpses — a country so beautiful that I have
seen nothing more charming — no, not in France, nor in
Spain, nor in Italy, nor in the novels of Mr. James.

I had pictured to myself a watering-place like Ems or
Wiesbaden, frequented by a number of agreeable ladies and
gentlemen ; woods, waterfalls, picnics, donkey excursions,
and waltzing on the grass with lovely young ladies ; a little
enlivenment of roulette in the evenings ; a battue, perhaps.



BEULAH SPA. 133

in the covers when the pheasant-shooting came ; and about
a thousand people meeting every morning at the Spa — the
majority of them, of course, handsome women. In fact, I
had stated such to be the case to my young friend Eawbold,
as we drove down.

We entered a lodge in the Swiss style ; and here a gen-
tleman demanded a shilling from us before we were free of
the Spa. " Is there a great deal of company staying at the
Spa ? " says I. " ToUol," says he, and motioned us into the
gardens.

They are beautiful. The prettiest lawns, the prettiest
flowers, rocks, grottoes, bridges, shrubberies, hermitages,
kioskS; and what not ; and charming bowers, wherein a man
might repose by the lady of his heart, and, methinks, be
supremely happy. But the company we saw were : —

Three trumpeters dressed in green, blowing Suoni la
tromba out of a canvas arbor — a most melancholy obligato ;

A snuffy little old gentleman, with two grandsons — one
a blue-coat boy. His yellow stockings glittered like butter-
cups on the sunshiny grass ;

A professional gipsy in a dark walk ;

And two pretty servant-maids carrying a small basket,
and on the look-out for their Masters and Missusses, who
were straying in some part of this Elysium.

When the trumpeters had done, a poor old wizened, grin-
ning, good-natured Italian, dressed up with a hat and pea-
cock's feathers — very like the monkey that accompanies
the barrel-organ — came up and began warbling, in rather
a sweet, feeble voice, the most seedy old songs.

There was something ludicrously sad in that honest crea-
ture's face. He didn't mind being laughed at, but joined
himself quite good-humoredly in the jocularity. At night,
he says, he takes off those gimcracks, and walks the streets
like another Christian. To have seen Harlequin in the
daylight is something. Rawbold, and even Augustus Fred-
eric, who had put up the cab by this time and joined us,
gave him moneys, — not for singing, but for looking so un-
utterably and pathetically comical. Do likewise, benevo-
lent reader, if thou recognizest the Troubadour of Beulah.
Then we strayed through shrubberies and rose-gardens
until we came to an archery-ground. Targets were set up,
just, for all the world, as in Ivanhoe — and a fellow in Lin-
coln-green came forward and invited us to the Butts. I
challenged Eawbold to a contest, and shot — with what



134 PAPERS BY PUNCH'S COMMISSIONER.

success you here behold. Eawbold hit no better : and the
odious fellow in Lincoln-green sneered all the while. " It
isn't the harrows that's bad," said he, sardonically, laugh-
ing at our complaints — they're good enough to shoot
with."

" Can you shoot with them ? " says Eawbold, piqued.

" I should think I could," replied Lincoln-green — and,
rather to his discomfiture, we called upon him to do so. He
levelled his arrow ; he bent and twiddled with his bow
previous to stringing it ; he lifted up to the sight-mark and
brought it down ; he put himself into an attitude so prodi-
giously correct, that we thought the bull's-eye might as well
shut up at once, for he was sure to hit it. We looked at
one another, as much as to say, "What a tremendous Sagit-
tarius of a fellow this Lincoln-green one is ! " At last,
whiz ! the arrow went.

It missed. The old humbug could no more shoot than
we could. He took twelve shots at the target, and didn't
hit it once. " There are many Lincoln-green ones in the
world," I said (apostrophizing young Augustus Frederic) ;
" fellows who pretend to do everything, and whom every-
body believes, because they brag so. Take warning by yon
pseudo-toxophilite, and be modest in all your dealings, my
little man."

And so we left the archery-ground with the most undis-
guised contempt. No new company had arrived at the Spa
during our brief absence. The little old man was still sun-
ning and snuffing himself on his bench. The Blue-coat boy
and his companion were still clambering over rustic arch-
ways. The two servant-maids had found Master and Mis-
sus, and were spreading out a cloth in an arbor.

We thought they might be going to dine — but not so.
They produced from the basket a loaf, hot — though, no
doubt, stale ; some butter in an almost melting state ; some
perspiring shrimps — and a screw of tea. I suppose they
took the Spa water for tea. The band began to blow when
this banquet was served — the poor minstrel came up, leer-
ing and grinning with his guitar, ready to perform for them
— they and we were the only guests of the place — the
solitude was intense. We left them there, of a gorgeous
summer afternoon, drinking tea and eating shrimps in the
sunshine.



BRIGHTON. 135



BEIGHTOK

AS there axe some consumptive travellers who, by dodg-
ing about to Italy, to Malta, to Madeira, manage to
cheat the winter, and for whose lungs a perpetual warmth
is necessary ; so there are people to whom, in like manner,
London is a necessity of existence, and who follow it all
the year round.

Such individuals, when London goes out of town, follow
it to Brighton, which is, at this season, London ^Zt^s prawns
for breakfast and the sea air. Blessings on the sea air,
which gives you an appetite to eat them !

You may get a decent bedroom and sitting-room here for
a guinea a day. Our friends the Botibols have three rooms,
and a bedstead disguised like a chest-of-drawers in the draw-
ing-room, for which they pay something less than a hundred
pounds a month. I could not understand last night why the
old gentleman, who usually goes to bed early, kept yawning
and fidgeting in the drawing-room after tea; until, with
some hesitation, he made the confession that the apartment
in question was his bedroom, and revealed the mystery of
the awful chest-of-drawers. Botibol's house in Bedford
Square is as spacious as an Italian palace ; the second-floor
front, in which the worthy man sleeps, would accommodate
a regiment ; and here they squeeze him into a chiffonniere !
How Mrs. B. and the four delightful girls can be stowed
away in the back room, I tremble to think : what bachelor
has a right to ask ? But the air of the sea makes up for
the closeness of the lodgings. I have just seen them on
the Cliff — mother and daughters were all blooming like
crimson double dahlias !

You meet everybody on that Cliff. For a small charge
you may hire the very fly here represented ; with the very
horse and the very postilion, in a pink striped chintz jacket
— which may have been the cover of an armchair once —
and straight whity-brown hair, and little wash-leather in-
expressibles, — the cheapest little caricature of a post-boy
eyes have ever lighted on.



136 PAPERS BY PUNCHES COMMISSIONER.

I seldom used to select his carriage, for the horse and
vehicle looked feeble, and unequal to bearing a person of
weight ; but last Sunday I saw an Israelitish family of dis-
tinction ensconced in the poor little carriage — the ladies
with the most flaming polkas, and flounces all the way up ;
the gent in velvet waistcoat, with pins in his breast big
enough once to have surmounted the door of his native
pawnbroker's shop, and a complement of hook-nosed chil-
dren, magnificent in attire. Their number and magnificence
did not break the carriage down ; the little postilion bumped
up and down as usual, as the old horse went his usual pace.
How they spread out, and basked, and shone, and were
happy in the sun there — those honest people !

The Mosaic Arabs abound here ; and they rejoice and are
idle with a grave and solemn pleasure, as becomes their
Eastern origin.

If you don't mind the expense, hire a ground-floor win-
dow on the Cliff, and examine the stream of human nature
which passes by. That stream is a league in length ; it
pours from Brunswick Terrace to Kemp Town, and then
tumbles back again ; and so rolls, and as it rolls perpetually,
keeps rolling on from three o'clock till dinner-time.

Ha ! what a crowd of well-known London faces you be-
hold here — only the sallow countenances look pink now,
and devoid of care.

I have seen this very day, at least —

Forty-nine Eailroad Directors, who would have been at
Baden-Baden but for the lines in progress ; and who, though
breathing the fresh air, are within an hour and a half of
the City.

Thirteen barristers, of more or less repute, including the
Solicitor-General himself, whose open and jovial counte-
tiance beamed with benevolence upon the cheerful scene.

A Hebrew dentist driving a curricle.

At least twelve well-known actors or actresses. It went
to my heart to see the most fashionable of them driving
about in a little four-wheeled pony-chaise, the like of which
might be hired for five shillings.

Then you have tight-laced dragoons, trotting up and
down with solemn, handsome, stupid faces, and huge yellow
mustachios. Myriads of flys, laden with happy cockneys ;
pathetic invalid-chairs all along, looking too much like cof-
fins already, in which poor people are brought out to catch

a glimpse of the sun. Grand equipages are scarce ; I saw

A BEIGHTON NIGHT ENTERTAINMENT.

HAVE always had a taste for the sec-
ond-rate in life. Second-rate poetry,
foi instance, is an uncommon deal
pleasanter to my fancy than your great
thundering firat-rate epic poems. Your
Miltons and Dantes are magnificent —
but a bore : whereas an ode of Horace,
or a, song of Tommy Moore, is always
fresh, sparkling, and welcome. Second-
rate claret, again, is notoriously better
■ than first-rate wine : you get the former
genuine, whereas the latter is a loaded
and artificial composition that cloys
the pjJate and bothers the reason.
Second-rate beauty in women is likewise, I maintain,
more agreeable than first-rate charms. Your first-rate
Beauty is grand, severe, awful — a faultless frigid angel of
five feet nine — superb to behold at church, or in the park,
or at a Drawing-room — but ah ! how inferior to a sweet
little second-rate creature, with smiling eyes, and a little
second-rate nes retroussS, with which you fall in love in a
minute.

Second-rate novels I also assert to be superior to the best
works of fiction. They give you no trouble to read, excite
no painful emotions — you go through them with a gentle,
languid, agreeable interest. Mr. James's romances are per-
fect in this way. The ne plus ultra, of indolence may be
enjoyed during their perusal.

For the same reason, I like second-rate theatrical enter-
tainments — a good little company in a provincial town,
acting good old stupid stock comedies and farces; where
nobody comes to the theatre, and you may lie at ease in the
pit, and get a sort of intimacy with each actor and actress,
and know every bar of the music that the three or four fid-
dlers of the little orchestra play throughout the season.
The Brighton Theatre would be admirable but for one



A BRIGHTON NIGHT ENTERTAINMENT. 189

thing — Mr. Hooper, the manager, will persist in having
Stars down from London — blazing Macreadys, resplendent
Miss Cushmans, fiery Wallacks, and the like. On these
occasions it is very possible that the house may be filled
and the manager's purpose answered ; but where does all
your comfort go then ? You can't loll over four benches
in the pit — you are squeezed and hustled in an incon-
venient crowd there — you are fatigued by the perpetual
struggles of the apple-and-gingerbeer boy, who will pass
down your row — and for what do you undergo this labor ?
To see Hamlet and Lady Macbeth, forsooth ! as if every-
body had not seen them a thousand times. No, on such
star nights "The Commissioner" prefers a walk on the
Cliff to the charms of the Brighton Theatre. I can have
first-rate tragedy in London : in the country give me good
old London fare — the good old comedies and farces — the
dear good old melodramas.

We had one the other day in perfection. We were, I
think, about four of us in the pit ; the gingerbeer boy might
wander about quite at his ease. There was a respectable
family in a private box, and some pleasant fellows in the
gallery ; and we saw, with leisure and delectation, that
famous old melodrama, " The Warlock of the Glen."

In a pasteboard cottage, on the banks of the Atlantic
Ocean, there lived once a fisherman, who had a little canvas
boat, in which it is a wonder he was never swamped, for the
boat was not above three feet long ; and I was astonished
at his dwelling in the cottage, too ; for though a two-storied
one, it was not above five feet high ; and I am sure the fish-
erman was six feet without his shoes.

As he was standing at the door of his cot, looking at some
young persons of the neighborhood who were dancing a
reel, a scream was heard, as issuing from the neighboring
forest, and a lady with dishevelled hair, and a beautiful in-
fant in her hand, rushed in. What meant that scream ?
We were longing to know, but the gallery insisted on the
reel over again, and the poor injured lady had to wait until
the dance was done before she could explain her unfor-
tunate case.

It was briefiy this : she was no other than Adela, Countess
of Glencairn; the boy in her hand was Glencairn's only
child : three years since her gallant husband had fallen in
fight, or, worse still, by the hand of the assassin.

He had left a brother, Clanronald. What was the con-



140 PAPERS BY PUNCH'S COMMISSIONER.

duct of that surviving relative ? Was it fraternal towards
the widowed Adela ? Was it avuncular to the orphan boy ?
Ah, no ! For three years he had locked her up in his cas-
tle, under pretence that she was mad, pursuing her all the
while with his odious addresses. But she loathed his suit ;
and refusing to become Mrs. (or Lady) Clanronald, took
this opportunity to escape and fling herself on the protec-
tion of the loyal vassals of her lord.




She had hardly told her pathetic tale when voices were
heard without. Cries of " Follow, follow ! '' resounded
through the wildwood ; the gentlemen and ladies engaged
in the reel fled, and the Countess iand her child, stepping
into the skiff, disappeared down a slope, to the rage and
disappointment of Clanronald, who now arrived — a savage-
looking nobleman indeed ! and followed by two ruffians of
most ferocious aspect, and having in their girdles a pair of
those little notched dumpy swords, with round iron hilts to
guard the knuckles, by which I knew that a combat would
probably take place ere long. And the result proved that
I was right.

Flying along the wild margent of the sea, in the next
act, the poor Adela was pursued by Clanronald ; but though
she jumped into the waves to avoid him, the unhappy lady
was rescued from the briny element, and carried back to



A BRIGHTON NIGHT BNTEKTAfNMENT. 141

her prison ; Clanronald swearing a dreadful oath that she
should many him that very day.

He meanwhile gave orders to his two ruffians, Murdoch
and Hamish, to pursue the little hoy into the wood, and
there — there -murder him.

But there is always a power in melodramas that watches
over innocence ; and these two wretched ones were pro-
tected by The Waklock of the Glen.




All through their misfortunes, this mysterious being
■watched them with a tender interest. When the two ruf-
fians were about to murder the child, he and the fisherman
rescued him — their battle-swords (after a brief combat of
four) sank powerless before his wizard staff, and they fled
in terror.

Haste we to the castle of Glencaim, What ceremony ia

men, and those three ladies in calico trains ? A marriage I

"you are mine. Eesistance is unavailing. Submit with

you from me ? "

" Mine can," cries the Warlock of the Glen, rushing in,

coiiimisaioned to s)aj^ — kuow tliat, for three years, a solemn
vow (sworn to the villain that spared his life, and expired
yesterday) bound him never to reveal his existence — know
that he is near at hand ; and repent, while jet there is
time."

The Lady Adela's emotion may be guessed when she heard
this news; but Clanronald received it with contemptuous
scepticism, "And where is this dead man come alive ? "
laughed he.

" He is heke," shouted the Warlock of the Glen ; and to
fling away Ms staff — to dash off his sham beard and blaek
gown — to appear in a red dress, with tights and yellow
boots, as became Glencairn's Earl — was the work of a mo-
ment. The Countess recognized him with a scream of joy,
Clanronald retired led o£f by two soldiers ; and the joy of
the Earl and Countess was completed by the arrivaj of
their only son (a clever little girl of the Hebrew persua-
sion) in the arms of the fisherman.




The curtain fell on this happy scene. The fiddlers had
ere this disappeared. The gingerbeer boy went home^ to
a virtuous family that was probably looking out for him.
The respectable family in the boxes went off in a fly. The
little audience spread! abroEid, and were lost in the laby-
rinths of the city. The lamps of the Theatre Eoyal were

MEDITATIONS OVER BRIGHTON.

(From the Devil's Dyke.)

WHEN the exultant and long-eared animal described
in the fable revelled madly in the frog-pond, dash-
ing about his tail and hoofs among the unfortunate inhab-
itants of that piece of water, it is stated that the frogs
remonstrated, exclaiming, "Why, donkey, do you come
kicking about in our habitation ? It may be good fun to
you to lash out, and plunge, and kick in this absurd man-
ner, but it is death to us:" on which the good-natured
quadruped agreed to discontinue his gambols ; and left the
frogs to bury their dead and rest henceforth undisturbed in
their pool.

The inhabitants of Brighton are the frogs — and I dare
say they will agree as to the applicability of the rest of the
simile. It might be good fun to me to " mark their man-
ners, and their ways survey ; " but could it be altogether
agreeable to them ? I am sorry to confess it has not
proved so, having received at least three hundred letters of
pathetic remonstrance, furious complaint, angry swagger, and
threatening omens, entreating me to leave the Brightonians
alone. The lodging-house keepers are up in arms. Mrs.
Screw says she never let her lodgings at a guinea a day,
and invites me to occupy her drawing and bed-room for five
guineas a week. Mr. Squeezer swears that a guinea a day
is an atrocious calumny : he would turn his wife, his chil-
dren, and his bedridden mother-in-law out of doors if he
could get such a sum for the rooms they occupy — (but this,
I suspect, is a pretext of Squeezer's to get rid of his mo-
ther-in-law, in which project I wish him luck). Mrs. Slop
hopes she may never again cut a slice out of a lodger's
joint (the cannibal !) if she won't be ready at the most
crowdidest of seasons to let her first-floor for six pounds ;
and, finally, Mr. Skiver writes : — " Sir, — Your ill-advised
publication has passed like a whirlwind over the lodging-
houses of Brighton. You have rendered our families deso-

late, and prematurely closed our season. As you have
destroyed the lodging-houses, couldn't you, now, walk into
the boarding-houses, and say a kind word to niia the
hotels ? "

And is it so ? Is the power of the Commissioner's eye
so fatal that it withers the object on which it falls ? Is
the condition of his life so dreadful that he destroys all
whom he comes near ? Have I mside a post-boy wretched
— five thousand lodging-house keepers furious — twenty
thousand Jews unhappy ? If so, and I reaUy possess a
power so terrible, I had best come out in the tragic line.

I went, pursuant to orders, to the Swiss Cottage, at
Shoieham, where the first object that struck my eye was the
following scene in the green lake there, which I am cred-
ibly informed is made of pea^-soup : two honest girls were




roiving about their friend, on this enchanting water. There
was a cloudless sky overhead — rich treats were advertised
for the six frequenters of the gardens ; a variety of enter-
tainments was announced in the Hall of Amusement — Mr.
and Mrs, Aminadab (here, too, the Hebrews have pene-
trated) were advertised as about to sing some of their most
favorite comic songs and —

But no, I will not describe the place. Why should my
fatal glance bring a curse upon it? The pearsoup lake
would dry up — leaving its bed a vacant tureen — the leaves
would drop from the scorched trees — the pretty flowers
would wither and fade — the rockets would not rise at
night, nor the rebel wheels go round — the money-taker at
the door would grow mouldy and die in his moss-grown
and deserted cell — Aminadab would lose his engagement.
Why should these things be, and this ruin occur ? James !
pack the portmanteau and tell the landlord to bring the
bill ; order horses immediately — this day I will quit
Brighton.

Other appalling facts have come to notice ; all showing
more or less the excitement created by my publication.

The officers of the 150th Hussars, accused of looking
handsome, solemn, and stupid, have had a meeting in the
messroom, where the two final epithets have been rescinded
in a string of resolutions.

But it is the poor yellow-breeched postilion who has most
suffered. When the picture of him came out, crowds
flocked to see him. He was mobbed all the way down the
Cliff ; wherever he drove his little phaeton, people laughed,
and pointed with the finger and said, " That is he." The
poor child was thus made the subject of public laughter by
my interference — and what has been the consequence ?
In order to disguise him as much as possible, his master
has bought him a hat.

The children of Israel are in a fury too. They do not
like to ride in flys, since my masterly representation of
them a fortnight since. They are giving up their houses
daily. You read in the Brighton papers, among the de-
partures, " Nebuzaradan, Esquire, and family for Lon-
don ; " or, " Solomon Ramothgilead, Esquire, has quitted
his mansion in Marine Crescent ; circumstances having in-
duced him to shorten his stay among us ; " and so on. The
people emigrate by hundreds ; they can't bear to be made
the object of remark in the public walks and drives — and
they are flying from a city of which they might have made
a new Jerusalem.

F the many indig-
nant remonstrants
who have written
regarding the opin-



claim
dore



the last lecture,
that there were no
Snobs in the L i t -
eraiy Profession, I
have thought it
best to address you
personally, and,
through you, the
many gentlemen
who are good
enough to point
out instances o f
literary characters
whom they are

E leased to think

to the rank of Snob. "Have you read poor Theo-
Crook's Life, as given in the Quarterly?" asks one;
, does any one merit the title of Snob more than that



ON LITERARY SNOBS, 147

poor fellow ? " " What do you say to Mrs. Cruor's novels,
and Mrs. Wollop's works of fashionable fiction ? " writes
some misogynist. " Was not Tom Macau a Snob when he
dated from Windsor Castle ? " asks a third. A fourth —
who is evidently angry on a personal matter, and has met
with a slight from Tom Fustian since he has come into his
fortune — begs us to show up that celebrated literary man.
" What do you say to Crawley Spoker, the man who doesn't
know where Bloomsbury Square is — the Marquis of Bor-
gia's friend ? " writes an angry patriot, with the Great Rus-
sell Street postmark. "What do you say to Bendigo de
Minories ? " demands another curious inquirer.

I think poor Crook's Life a wholesome one. It teaches
you not to put your trust in great people — in great, splen-
did, and titled Snobs. It shows what the relations between
the poor Snob and the rich Snob are. Go to a great man's
table, dear Smith, and know your place there. Cut jokes,
make songs, grin and chatter for him as his monkey does,
and amuse him, and eat your victuals, and elbow a Duchess,
and be thankful, you rogue ! Isn't it pleasant to read your
name among the fashionables in the papers ? — Lord Hook-
ham, Lord Charles Snivey, Mr. Smith.

Mrs. Cruor's works and Mrs. WoUop's novels are also
wholesome, if not pleasant reading. For these ladies, mov-
ing at the tip-top of fashion, as they undoubtedly do, and
giving accurate pictures of the genteel, serve to warn many
honest people who might otherwise be taken in, and show
fashionable life to be so utterly stupid, mean, tedious, driv-
elling, and vulgar, as to reconcile spirits otherwise discon-
tented to mutton and Bloomsbury Square.

As for the Eight Honorable Mr. Macau — I perfectly well
recollect the noise which was made about that Right Honor-
able gentleman's audacity in writing a letter from Windsor
Castle, and think — that he was a Snob for putting such
an address to his letter ? — No ; only that the Public was
a Snob for making such a pother about it, — the public —
that looks at Windsor Castle with terror, and thinks it blas-
phemy to speak familiarly about it.

In the first place, Mr. Macau was there, and therefore
could not be anywhere else. Why should he, then, being
at one place, date his letter from any other ? Then, I con-
ceive, he has as good a right to be in Windsor Castle as the
Royal Albert himself. Her Majesty (be it spoken with the
respect that so awful a theme merits !) is the august house-



148 ''SNOB'' PAPERS,

keeper of that public residence. Part of her royal duty is
a gracious hospitality and reception of the chief officers of
the nation ; therefore I opine that Mr. Macau had as good a
right to his apartment at Windsor Castle as to his red box
in Downing Street ; and had no call to go to Windsor in
secret, or to be ashamed of going thither, or to conceal his
residence there.

As for honest Tom Fustian, who has cut " Libertas " —
"Libertas" must suffer under the calamity — until Tom
publishes another novel ; about a month before which time,
Libertas, as critic of the Weekly Tomahawk, will probably
receive a most affectionate invitation to Fustianville Lodge.
About this time Mrs. Fustian will call upon Mrs. Libertas
(in her yellow chariot lined with pink, and a green ham-
mercloth) and make the tenderest inquiries about the dear
little children. All this is very well, but Libertas should
understand his place in the world ; an author is made use
of when wanted, and then dropped; he must consent to
mix with the genteel world upon these conditions, and Fus-
tian belongs to the world now that he has a yellow chariot
and pink lining.

AU the world cannot be expected to be so generous as the
Marquis of Borgia, Spoker's friend. That was a generous
and high-minded nobleman — a real patron if not of letters
at least of literary men. My lord left Spoker almost as
much money as he left to Centsuisse, his valet — forty or
fifty thousand pounds apiece to both of the honest fellows.
And they deserved it. There are some things, dear Smith,
that Spoker knows ; though he doesn't know where Blooms-
bury Square is — and some very queer places too.

And, finally, concerning young Ben de Minories. Wliat
right have I to hold up that famous literary man as a speci-
men of the Great Britannic Literary Snob ? Mr. de Mi-
nories is not only a man of genius (as you are, my dear
Smith, though your washerwoman duns you for her little
bill), but he has achieved those advantages of wealth which
you have not, and we should respect him as our chief and
representative in the circles of the fashion. When the
Choctaw Indians were here some time ago, who was the in-
dividual whose self and house were selected to be shown
to those amiable foreigners as models of the establishment
and the person of " an English gentleman '^ ? Of all Eng-
land, De Minories was the man that was selected by Gov-
ernment as the representative of the British aristocracy. I



ON LITERARY SNOBS, 149

know it's true. I saw it in the papers : and a nation never
paid a higher compliment to a literary man.

And I like to see him in his public position — a quill-
driver, like one of us — I like to see him because he makes
our profession respected. For what do we admire Shake-
speare so much as for his wondrous versatility ? He must
have been everything he describes : Falstaff, Miranda, Cali-
ban, Marc Antony, Ophelia, Justice Shallow — and so I
say De Minories must know more of politics than any man,
for he has been (or has offered to be) everything. In the
morning of life Joseph and Daniel were sponsors for the
blushing young neophyte, and held him up at the font of
freedom. It would make a pretty picture ! Circumstances
occasioned him to quarrel with the most venerable of his
godfathers, and to modify the opinions advanced on the
generosity of his youth. Would he have disliked a place
under the Whigs ? Even with them, it is said, the young
patriot was ready to serve his country. Where would Peel
be now had he known his value ? I turn from the har-
rowing theme, and depict to myself the disgust of the Eo-
mans when Coriolanus encamped before the Porta del Po-
polo, and the mortification of Francis the First when he
saw the Constable Bourbon opposite to him at Pavia.
" Raro antecedentem, &c. deseruit pede Poena claudo " (as
a certain poet remarks) ; and I declare I know nothing
more terrible than Peel, at the catastrophe of a sinister ca-
reer — Peel writhing in torture, with Nemesis de Minories
down upon him.

I know nothing in Lempriere's Dictionary itself more
terrific than that picture of godlike vengeance. What !
Peel thought to murder Canning, did he ? and to escape
because the murder was done twenty years ago ? No, no.
What ! Peel thought to repeal the Corn Laws, did he ? In
the first place, before Com bills or Irish bills are settled,
let us know who was it that killed Lord George Bentinck's
" relative " ? Let Peel answer for that murder to the coun-
try, to the weeping and innocent Lord George, and to Nem-
esis de Minories, his champion.

I call his interference real chivalry. I regard Lord
George's affection for his uncle-in-law as the most elegant
and amiable of the qualities of that bereaved young noble-
man — and I am proud, dear Smith, to think that it is a
man of letters who backs him in his disinterested feud ;
that if Lord George is the head of the great English coun-



150 **SNOB'' PAPERS.

tiy painty, it is a man of letters who is viceroy over him.
Happy country ! to have such a pair of saviors ! Happy
Lord George ! to have such a friend and patron — happy
men of letters ! to have a man out of their ranks the chief
and savior of the nation.



ON SOME POLITICAL SNOBS. 151



ON SOME POLITICAL SNOBS.

T DON'T know where the Snob-Amateur finds more speci-
i mens of his favorite species than in the political world.
Whig Snobs, Tory and Eadical Snobs, Conservative and
Young England Snobs, Official and Parliamentary Snobs,
Diplomatic Snobs, and About-the-Court Snobs present them-
selves to the imagination in numberless and graceful vari-
eties, so that I scarcely know which to show up first.

My private friends are aware that I have an aunt who is
a Duchess, and as such, Lady of the Powder-Closet ; and
that my cousin. Lord Peter, is Pewter-Stick in Waiting and
Groom of the Dust-Pan. Had these dear relatives been
about to hold their positions, nothing would have induced
me to be savage upon that dismal branch of the political
Snobs to which they belong ; but her Grace and Lord Peter
are going out with the present administration ; and per-
haps it will alleviate the bitterness occasioned by their
own resignation, if we have a little fun and abuse of their
successors.

This is written before the Ministerial changes are
avowed ; but I hear in the best society (indeed Tom Spiffle
told me at the Baron de Houndsditch's dejeuner at Twick-
enham last week) that Lionel Kampant succeeds to my
cousin Peter's Pewter-Stick ; Toffy is next to certain of the
Dust-Pan; whilst the Powder-Closet has been positively
promised to Lady Gules.

What the deuce can her ladyship want with such a place ?
is a question which suggests itself to my simple mind. If
I had thirty thousand a year, if I had gouty feet (though
this is a profound secret), and an amiable epileptic husband
at home like Lord Gules, and a choice of town and country
houses, parks, castles, villas, books, cooks, carriages, and
other enjoyments and amusements, would I become a sort-
of-Brkind of a what-d'ye-call-'em — of an upper servant, in
fact — to a personage ever so illustrious and beloved ?
Would I forsake my natural rest, my home and society, my
husband, family, and independence, to take charge of any



152 '*SNOB'' PAPERS.

powder-puff in any establishment; to speak under my
breath, to stand up for hours before any young prince, how-
ever exalted? Would I consent to ride backwards in a
carriage, when the delicacy of my constitution rendered that
mode of transit peculiarly odious to me, because there was
a scutcheon, surmounted by the imperial crown, on the pan-
els, of which the chief was a field or with three lions gules ?
No. I would yield in affection for my Institutions to none ;
but I would cultivate my loyalty, and respect my Crown de
loin. For, say what you will, there is always something
ludicrous and mean in the character of a flunkey. About a
neat-handed Phillis, who lays your table and brushes your
carpet without pretension ; a common servant who brushes
your boots and waits behind your chair in his natural and
badly-made black coat, there is no absurdity or incongruity ;
but when you get to a glorified flunkey, in lace, plush, and
aiguillettes, wearing a bouquet that nobody wears, a pow-
dered head that nobody wears, a gilt cocked-hat only fit for
a baboon, — I say the well-constituted man can't help grin-
ning at this foolish, monstrous, useless, shameful carica-
ture of a man which Snobbishness has set up to worship ;
to straddle behind its carriage with preternatural calves ; to
carry its prayer-book to church in a velvet bag ; to hand it
little three-cornered notes, bowing solemnly over a silver
tea-tray, &c. There is something shameful and foolish, I
say, in John as at present constituted.

We can't be inen and brothers as long as that poor devil
is made to antic before us in his present fashion — as long
as the unfortunate wretch is not allowed to see the insult
passed upon him by that ridiculous splendor. This reform
must be done. We have abolished negro slavery. John
must now be emancipated from plush. And I expect that
flunkeys unborn will thank and bless Punch ; and if he
has not a niche beside William Wilberf orce in the Palace of
Westminster, at least he ought to have a statue in the wait-
ing-room where the servants assemble.

And if John is ridiculous, is not a Pewter-Stick in wait-
ing ? If John in his yellow plush inexpressibles dangling
behind my lady's carriage, or sauntering up and down be-
fore Saint James's Palace while his mistress is spreading
out her train at the Drawing-room, is an object of the sad-
dest contempt, poor fellow, of the most ludicrous splendor
— one of the most insane and foolish live caricatures which
this present age exhibits — is my lord Peter the Pewter-



ON SOME POLITICAL SNOBS. 183

Stick far behind him ? And do you think, my deax sir,
that the public will bear this kind of thing for many cen-
turies longer ? How long do you suppose Court Circulars
will last, and those tawdry old-world humiliating ceremo-
nials which they chronicle ? When I see a body of beef-
eaters in laced scarlet ; a parcel of tradesmen dressed up as
soldiers, and calling themselves Gentleman Pensioners, and
what not ; a theatre manager (though this I acknowledge,
by the way, is seldom enough) grinning before Majesty with
a pair of candles, and walking backwards in a Tom-Fool's
coat, with a sword entangling his wretched legs ; a bevy of
pompous officers of the household bustling and strutting
and clearing the way — am I filled with awe at the august
ceremony? Ought it to inspire respect? It is no more
genuine than the long faces of mutes at a funeral — no more
real than Lord George Bentinck's grief about Mr. Canning,
let us say. What is it makes us all laugh at the picture in
the last number (which picture is alone worth the price of
the volume), of "Punch presenting ye Tenth Volume to
y« Queene " ? The admirable manner in which the Gothic
art and ceremony is ridiculed ; the delightful absurdity and
stiffness ; the outrageous aping of decorum ; the cumbrous
ludicrous nonsensical splendor. Well : the real pageant is
scarcely less absurd — the Chancellor's wig and mace almost
as old and foolish as the Jester's cap and bauble. Why is
any Chancellor, any Stage-Manager, any Pewter-Stick, any
John called upon to dress himself in any fancy dress, or to
wear any badge ? I respect my Bishop of London, my
Eight Reverend Charles James, just as much since he left
off a wig as I did when he wore one. I should believe in
the sincerity of his piety, even though a John, in purple
raiment (looking like a sort of half-pay Cardinal), didn't
carry his lordship's prayer-books in a bag after him to the
Chapel Royal ; nor do I think Royalty would suffer, or
Loyalty be diminished, if Gold, Silver, and Pewter-Sticks
were melted, and if the grandes charges a la Cour — Ladies
of the Powder-Closet, Mistresses of the Pattens, and the
like, were abolished in scecula sceculorum.

And I would lay a wager, that by the time Punch has
published his eightieth volume, the ceremonies whereof we
have here been treating will be as dead as the Corn Laws,
and the nation will bless Punch and Peel for destroying
both.



"SNOB" PAPERS.



ON WHIG SNOBS.




E don't know — we are
too modest to calculate
(every man wlio sends in
his contributions to Mr.
Punch's broad sheet is
modest) the effect of our
works, and the influence
which they may have on
society and the world.

Two instances — a
propos of the above state-
ment of opinion — occur-
red last week. My dear
friend and fellow-con-
tributor Jones (I shall
call him Jones, though
his patronymic is one of the most distiuguisbed in this
Empire) wrote a paper entitled "Black Monday," in which
the claims of the Whiga to office were impEirtiaily set forth,
and their title to heaven-bom statesmanship rather scepti-
cally questioned. The sic vos non vobis was Jones's argu-
ment. The Whigs don't loam the fields aud buzz from
flower to flower, as the industrious bees do ; but they take
possession of the hives and the honey. The Whigs don't
build the nests like the feathered songsters of the grove, but
they come in for those nests and the eggs which they contain.
They magnanimously reap what the nation sows, and are
perfectly contented with their mode of practice, and think
the country ought to love and admire them excessively for
condescending to take advantage of its labor.

This was Jones's argument. "You let Cobden do all the
work," says he, " and having done it, you appropriate the
proceeds calmly to yourselves, and ofter him a fifteenth-
rate place in your sublime corps." Jones was speaking of
the first and abortive attempt of the Whigs to take office



ON WHIG SNOBS. 156

last year ; when they really offered Richard Cobden a place
something better than that of a Downing Street messen-
ger; and actually were good enough to propose that he
should enjoy some such official dignity as that of carrying
Lord Tom Noddy's red box.

What ensued last week, when Peel gave in his adhesion
to Free Trade, and meekly resigning his place and emolu-
ments, walked naked out of office into private life ? John
Russell and Company stepped in to assume those garments
which, according to that illustrious English gentleman, the
Member for Shrewsbury, the Right Honorable Baronet had
originally " conveyed " from the Whigs, but which (accord-
ing to Jones and every contributor to Punch) the Whigs
themselves had abstracted from Richard Cobden, Charles
Villiers, John Bright, and others, — what, I say, ensued ?
Dare you come forward, Whigs ? Jones exclaimed. —
Whig Snobs ! I cry out with all my heart, you put Richard
Cobden and his fellows into the rear rank, and claim the
victory which was won by other and better swords than
your puny twiddling Court blades ever were ? Do you
mean to say that you are to rule ; and Cobden is to be held
of no account ? It was thus that at a contest for Shrews-
bury, more severe than any Mr. B. Disraeli ever encoun-
tered, one Ealstaff came forward and claimed to have slain
Hotspur, when the noble Harry had run him through. It
was thus in Erance that some dandified representatives of
the people looked on when Hoche or Bonaparte won the
victories of the Republic.

What took place in consequence of Punches remon-
strance ? The Whigs offered a seat in the Cabinet to Rich-
ard Cohden, With humble pride, I say, as a member of the
Punch administration, that a greater compliment was never
offered to our legislatorial body.

And now with respect to my own little endeavor to ad-
vance our country's weal. Those who remember the last
week's remarks on Political Snobs must recollect the simili-
tude into which, perforce, we entered — the comparison of
the British Elunkey with the Court Elunkey — the great
official Household Snob. Poor John in his outrageous
plush and cocked-hat, with his absurd uniform, facings,
aiguillettes ; with his bag-wig and powder ; with his amaz-
ing nosegay in his bosom, was compared to the First Lord
of the Dustpan, or the Head Groom of the Pantry, and the
motto enforced on the mind was —

" AM 1 NOT A MAN AND A BROTHER ^ "

The result of this good-humored and elegant piece of
satire is to be found in the Times newspaper of Saturday,
the 4th July : —

" We understand ihst aiCnationa in the Household haTe been offered to
his grace the Duke of Stilton, and his grace the Duke of Donblegloncea-
ter. Tlieir graces have declined the honor which was proposed to them,
hut have nevertheless signified their intention of supporting publicly tha
new administration."

Could a public writer have a greater triumph ! I make no
manner of doubt that the Dukes alluded to have, upon

determined that they will wear no livery however august ;
that they will take no service however majestic, but con-
tent themselves with the modesty of their independence,
and endeavor to live reputably upon five hundred or a thou-
sand pounds per diem. If Punch has been able to effect
these reforms in a single week — to bring the great Whig
party to acknowledge that there are, after all, as great, nay,
better men than they in this wicked world — to induce the
great Whig magnates to see that servitude — servitude to
the greatest Prince out of the smallest and most illustrious
Court in Deutschland — does not become their station, —
why, we are baulked of the best part of our article on
Snobs. The paper is already written.

Perhaps the race is extinct (or on the verge of extinc-
tion), with its progeny of puny philosophers, and dandy
patriots, and polite philanthropists, and fond believers in
House of Commons traditions. Perhaps My Lord and Sir
Thomas will condescend, from their parks and halls, to
issue manifestoes to the towns and villages, and say, " We
approve of the wishes of the people to be represented. We
thmk that their grievances are not without foundation, and
we place ourselves at their head in our infinite wisdom, in
order to overcome the Tories, their enemies and our own.''
Perhaps, I say, the magnificent Whigs have at last discov-
ered that without a regiment, volunteer officers, ever so be-
dizened with gold lace, are not particularly efficient ; that
without a ladder even the most aspiring Whigs cannot
climb to eminence ; that the nation, in a word, no more
cares for the Whigs than it cares for the Stuart dynasty, or
for the Heptarchy, or for George Canning, who passed away
some few hundred years afterwards ; or for any collapsed
tradition. The Whigs ? Charles Pox was a great man in
his time, and so were the archers with their long-bows at
Agincourt. But gunpowder is better. The world keeps
moving. The great time-stream rushes onward; and just
now a few little Whigling heads and bodies are bobbing
and kicking on the surface.

My dearest friend, the period of submersion comes, and
down they go, down among the dead men, and what need
have we to act as humanity-men, and hook out their poor
little bodies ?

A paper about Whig Snobs is therefore absurd I

commanders or emperors or champions — when they are
only a little way removed from a strait-waistcoat, and barely
tolerated at large.

In regard of Political Snobs, the more I consider them
the more this feeling of compassion predominates, until,
were all the papers ujon Snobs to be written in the same
key, we should have, instead of a lively and facetious series
of essays, a collection that would draw tears even from
undertiJiers, and would be about as jovial as Dr. Dodd's

knows he was a Snob. But he repents and shows signs of
grace : he comes down on his knees and confesses his errors

our arms and say, " Bobby my boy, let bygones be bygones ;
it is never too late to repent. Come and join us, and don't

more. We receive him, and protect him from the Snobs,
his ex-companions, who are howling without, and he is as

Then there are the Whigs. They rejoice in power ; they
have got what they panted for — that possession in Down-
ing Street for which, to hear some of them, you would have
fancied they were destined by Heaven. Well — now they
are in place — to do them justice, they are comporting them-
selves with much meekness. They are giving a share of
their good things to Catholics as well as Protestants. They
don't say, " No Irish need apply," but enliven the Cabinet
with a tolerable sprinkling of the brogue. Lord John
comes before his constituents with a humble and contrite
air, and seems to say, " Gentlemen ! Although the Whigs
are great, there is something, after all, greater — I mean

for whose welfare we promise to work zealously." Under
such dispositions, who can be angry with Whig Snobs ? —
only a misanthropic ruffian who never took in a drop of the
milk of human kindness.

Finally, there are the Conservative, or — as the poor
devils call themselves now — the Country-Party Snobs.
Can anybody be angry with them ? Can anyone consider
Don Quixote an accountable being, or feel alarmed by
Geoffrey Hudson's demeanor when he arms in a fury and
threatens to run you through ?

I had gone down last week (for the purpose of meditat-
ing, at ease and in fresh air, upon our great subject of
Snobs), to a secluded spot called the Trafalgar Hotel, at
Greenwich, when, interrupted by the arrival of many scores
of most wholesome-looking men, in red faces and the fair-
est of linen, I asked Augustus Prederic, the waiter, what
this multitude was that was come down to create a scarcity
amongst the whitebait ? " Don't you know, sir ! '' says he.
"It's THE Country-Party." And so it was. The real,
original, unbending, no-surrender aristocrats; the men of
the soil ; our old old leaders ; our Plantagenets ; our Somer-

sets ; our Disraelis ; our Hudsons ; and our Stanleys. They
have turned out in force, and for another struggle ; they
have taken " the Rupert of debate," Geoffrey Stanley, for
leader, and set up their standard of "No Surrender" on
Whitebait Hill.

As long as we have Cromwell and the Ironsides, the
honest Country-Party are always welcome to Eupert and
the Cavaliers. Besides, hasn't the member for Pontefract*
come over to us ? and isn't it all up with the good old cause
now he has left it ?

My heart then, far from indulging in rancor towards those
poor creatures, indulged only in the softest emotions in
their behalf; I blessed them as they entered the dinner-
room by twos and threes, as they consigned their hats to
the waiters with preternatural solemnity'', and rushed in to
conspire. Worthy, chivalrous, and mistaken Snobs, I said,
mentally, " Go and reclaim your rights over bowls of water-
souchy ; up with your silver forks and chivalry of England,
and pin to earth the manufacturing caitiffs who would rob
you of your birthrights. Down with all Cotton-spinners !
Saint George for the Country-Party! A Geoffrey to the
rescue ! " I respect the delusion of those poor souls. What !
repeal the repeal of the Corn Laws ? Bring us back the
good old Tory times ? No, no ! Humpty-Dumpty has had
a great fall, and all the Queen's horses and all the Queen's
men can't put Humpty-Dumpty straight again. Let the
honest creatures cry out " No Surrender ! " and let us laugh
as we are winning, and listen to them in good-humor. We
know what " No Surrender " means — any time these fif-
teen years. " It is the nature of the popular hellua,^^ says
the dear old Quarterly Review, with its usual grace and
polite felicity of illustration, " never to be sated, and to in-
crease in voracity and audacity by every sop that is thrown
to it." Bit by bit, day by day, ever since the Reform Bill,
the poor devils whom the old Quarterly represents have
had to feed the popular hellua — as anybody may see who
reads the periodical in question. " No Surrender ! " bellows
the Quarterly, but Bellua demands a Catholic Emancipation
Act, and bolts it, and is not satisfied ; — a Reform Act — a
Corporation and Test Act — a Eree-Trade Act — Bellua
swallows all. horror of horrors ! poor dear bewil-

And shall we be angry with the poor victim ? Have you,

playfully, and — gobbles him at the proper season.

AEE THERE ANY WHIG SNOBS ?

ORTUNATELY this is going to be
quite a little cliapter. I am not going,
like Thomas of Finsbury, to put ugly
questions to Government, or obstruct
in any way the march of the Great
Liberal Administration. The bpst
thing we can do is not to ask questions
at all, but to trust the Whigs impli-
citly, and rely on their superior wis-
dom. They are wiser than we are. A
kind Providence ordained that they
should govern us, and endowed them
with universal knowledge. Other people change their opin-
ions; they never do. For instance. Peel avows that his
opinions on the Corn Laws have gone right round — the
Whigs have never changed; they have always held the
Free-Trade doctrines ; they have always been wise and per-
fect. We did n't know it : but it's the fact — Lord John
says so. And the great Whig chiefs go down to their con-
stituents, and congratulate themselves and the world that
Commercial Freedom is the Law of the Empire, and bless
Heaven for creating Whigs to expound this great truth to
the world. Free Trade ! Heaven bless you ! the Whigs in-
vented Free Trade — and everything else that ever has
been invented. Some day or other — when the Irish
Church goes by the board ; when, perhaps, the State Church
follows it ; when Household Suffrage becomes an acknowl-
edged truth; when Education actually does become Na-
tional ; when even the Five Points of Thomas of Finsbury
come to be visible to the naked eye — you will see the
Whigs always were advocates for Household Suffrage ; that
they invented National Education ; that they were the boys
who settled the Church Question ; and that they had them-
selves originated the Five Points, of which Feargus O'Con-
nor was trying to take the credit. Where there ^s Perfec-
tion there can't be Snobbishness. The Whigs have known



ARE THERE ANY WHIG SNOBS? 163

and done — know and do — will know and do — every-
thing.

And again, you can't expect reasonably to find many
Snobs among them. There are so few of them. A fellow
who writes a book about the Aristocracy of England, and
calls himself Hampden Junior (and who is as much like
John Hampden as Mr. Punch is like the Apollo Belvedere),
enumerates a whole host of trades, and names of English-
men who have been successful in them ; and finds that the
Aristocracy has produced — no good tin-men, let us say, or
lawyers, or tailors, or artists, or divines, or dancers on the
tight-rope, or persons of other callings ; whereas out of the
People have sprung numbers more or less who have dis-
tinguished themselves in the above professions. The infer-
ence of which is,tthat the aristocracy is the inferior, the
people the superior race. This is rather hard of Hampden
Junior, and not quite a fair argument against the infamous
and idiotic aristocracy ; for it is manifest that a lord cannot
play upon the fiddle, or paint pictures by a natural gift and
without practice; that men adopt professions in order to
live, and if they have large and comfortable means of live-
lihood are, not uncommonly, idle. The sham Hampden, I
say, does not consider that their lordships have no call to
take upon themselves the exercise of the above-named pro-
fessions ; and, above all, omits to mention that the people
are as forty thousand to one to the nobility ; and hence,
that the latter could hardly be expected to produce so many
distinguished characters as are to be found in the ranks of
the former.

In like manner (I am willing to confess the above illus-
tration is confoundedly long, but in a work on Snobs a
Radical Snob may have a passing word as well as another),
I say, there can't be many Snobs among Whigs ; there are
so very few Whigs among men.

I take it there are not above one hundred real downright
live Whigs in the world — some five-and-twenty, we will
say, holding office ; the remainder ready to take it. You
can't expect to find many of the sort for which we are seek-
ing in such a small company. How rare it is to meet a real
acknowledged Whig ! Do you know one ? Do you know
what it is to be a Whig ? I can understand a man being
anxious for this measure or that, wishing to do away with
the sugar duties, or the corn duties, or the Jewish disabil-
ities, or what you will ; but in that case, if Peel will do my

business and get rid of the nuisance for me, he answers my
purpose just as well as anybody else with any other name.
I want my house set in order, my room made clean ; I do
not make particular inquiries about the broom and the dust-
pan.

To be a Whig you must be a reformer — as much or littlo
of this as you like — and something more. You must be-
lieve not only that the Com Laws must be repealed, but
that the Whigs must be in office ; not only that Ireland
must be tranquil, but that the Whigs must be in Downing
Street : if the people will have reforms, why of course you
can't help it; but remember, the Whigs are to have the
credit. I believe that the world is the Whigs', and that
everything they give us is a blessing. When Lord John
the other day blessed the people at Guijdhall, and told us
all how the Whigs had got the Corn Bill for us, I declare I
think we both believed it. It was n't Cobden and Villiers
and the people that got it — it was the Whigs, somehow,
that octroy&d the measure to us.

They are our superiors, and that's the fact. There is
what Thomas of Finsbury almost blasphemously called a
"Whig Dodge," — and beats all other dodges. I am not a
Whig myself (perhaps it is as unnecessary to say so, as to
say I'm not King Pippin in a golden coach, or King Hud-
son, or Miss Burdett-Coutts) — I'm not a Whig; but, oh,
how I should like to be one !

OIT THE SNOB CIVILIAN.

NOTHING can be more disgusting or atrocious than the
exhibition of incendiary ignorance, malevolent con-
ceit, and cowardly ill-will which has been exhibited by the
Pekins of the public press, and a great body of Civilian
Snobs in the country, towards the most beloved of our in-
stitutions ; that Institution, the health of which is always
drunk after the Church at public dinners — the British
Army. I myself, when I wrote a slight dissertation upon
Military Snobs — called upon to do so by a strict line of
duty — treated them with a tenderness and elegant polite-
ness which I am given to understand was admired and ap-
preciated in the warlike Clubs, in messes, and other solda-
tesque societies ; but to suppose that criticism should go so
far as it has done during the last ten days ; that every un-
educated Cockney should presume to have a judgment ; that
civilians at taverns and Clubs should cry shame ; that pa-
triots in the grocery or linendrapery line should venture to
object ; that even ignorant women and mothers of families,
instead of superintending the tea and bread and butter at
breakfast, should read the newspapers, forsooth, and utter
their shrill cries of horror at the account of the Floggings
at Hounslow* — to suppose, I say, that society should make
such a hubbub as it has done for the last fortnight, and that
perhaps at every table in England there should be a cry of
indignation — this is too much — the audacity of Civilian
Snobs is too great, and must be put an end to at once. I
take part against the Pekins, and am authorized to say,
after a conversation with Mr. Punch, that that gentleman
shares in my opinion that the Army must he protected.

The answer which is always to be made to the Civilian
Snob when he raises objections against military punish-
ments, promotions, purchases, or what not, is invariable. —



* Much excitement had been caused by the death of a private of the 7th
HnssarSy in consequence of a severe flogging to which he was sentenced for
striking his sergeant.



166 *'SNOB'* PAPERS,

He knows nothing about it. — How the deuce can you specu-
late about the army, Pekin, who don't know the difference
between a firelock and a fusee ?

This point I have seen urged, with great effect, in the
military papers, and most cordially agree that it is an ad-
mirable and unanswerable argument. A particular genius,
a profound study, an education specially military, are requi-
site before a man can judge upon so complicated a matter
as the army ; and these, it is manifest, few civilians can
have enjoyed. But any man who has had the supreme
satisfaction of making the acquaintance of Ensign and
Lieutenant Grigg of the Guards, Captain Eamish of the
Hottentot Buffs, or hundreds of young gentlemen of their
calling, must acknowledge that the army is safe under the
supervision of men like these. Their education is brilliant,
their time is passed in laborious military studies ; the con-
versation of mess-rooms is generally known to be philo-
sophical, and the pursuits of officers to be severely scientific.
So ardent in the acquisition of knowledge in youth, what
must be their wisdom in old age ? By the time Grigg is a
Colonel (and, to be sure, knowledge grows much more rap-
idly in tne Guard regiments, and a young veteran may be
a Colonel at five-and-twenty), and Famish has reached the
same rank — these are the men who are more fitted than
ever for the conduct of the army ; and how can any civilian
know as much about it as they ? These are the men whose
opinions the civilians dare to impugn ; and I can conceive
nothing more dangerous, insolent — Snobbish, in a word —
than such an opposition.

When men such as these, and the very highest authorities
in the army, are of opinion that flogging is requisite for the
British soldier, it is manifestly absurd of the civilian to
interfere. Do you know as much about the army and the
wants of the soldier as Field-Marshal the Duke of Welling-
ton ? If the Great Captain of the Age considers flogging
is one of the wants of the army, what business have you
to object. YouWe not flogged. You are a Pekin. To lash
fellow-creatures like hounds may be contrary to your ideas
of decency, morals, and justice ; to submit Christian men
to punishments brutal, savage, degrading, ineffectual, may
be revolting to you ; but to suppose that such an eminent
philanthropist as the Great Captain of the Age would allow
such penalties to be inflicted on the troops if they could be
done away with, is absurd. A word from the Chiefs of the

army, and the Cat might have takeu its place as an histori-
cal weapon in the Tower, along with the boots and the
thumbscrews of the Spanish Armada. But, say you, very
likely the Great Captain of his Age, the Duke of Alva,
might have considered thumbscrews and boots just as
necessary for discipline as the Cat is supposed to be now.
Pekin ! Don't meddle with subjects quite beyond the
sphere of your knowledge. Respect the Articles of War,
and remember that the majority of officers of the British
army, from his grace down to Ensign Grigg, are of opinion
that flogging can't be done away with.

You can't suppose that they are inhumane. When that
wretched poor fellow was lashed to the ladder at Houns-
low, and as the farriers whirled the Cat over him, not only
men, but officers, it is stated, turned sick and fainted at the
horrible spectacle. At every military punishment, I am
told that men so drop down. Nature itself gives way,
making, as it were, a dying protest against that disgusting
scene of torture. Nature : yes ! But the army is not a
natural profession. It is out of common life altogether.
Drilling — red coats, all of the same pattern, with the same
number of buttons — flogging — marching with the same
leg foremost — are not natural : put a bayonet into a man's
hand, he would not naturally thrust it into the belly of a
Frenchman: very few men of their own natural choice
would wear, by way of hat, such a cap as Colonel Whyte
and his regiment wear every day — a muff, with a red
worsted bag dangling down behind it, and a shaving-brush
stuck by way of ornament in front : the whole system is
something egregious — artificial. The civilian, who lives
out of it, can't understand it. It is not like the other pro-
fessions, which require intelligence. A man one degree
removed from idiocy, with brains just sufficient to direct
his powers of mischief or endurance, may make a distin-
guished soldier. A boy may be set over a veteran : we see
it every day. A lad with a few thousand pounds may pur-
chase a right to command which the most skilful and sci-
entific soldier may never gain. Look at the way Ensign
Grigg, just come from school, touches his cap to the enor-
mous old private who salutes him — the gladiator of five-
and-twenty campaigns.

And if the condition of the officer is wonderful and
anomalous, think of that of the men ! There is as much
social difference between Ensign Grigg and the big gladi-



168 "SNOB** PAPERS.

ator, as there is between a gang of convicts working in the
hulks and the keepers in charge of them. Hundreds of
thousands of men eat, march, sleep, and are driven hither
and thither in gangs all over the world — Grigg and his
clan riding by and superintending; they get the word of
command to advance or fall back, and they do it ; they are
told to strip, and they do it ; or to flog, and they do it ; to
murder or to be murdered, and they obey — for their food
and clothing, and twopence a day for beer and tobacco. Eor
nothing more : — no hope — no ambition — no chance for
old days but Chelsea Hospital. How many of these men,
in time of war, when their labor is most needed and best
paid, escape out of their slavery ! Between the soldier and
the officer there is such a gulf fixed, that to cross it is
next to a miracle. There was one Mameluke escaped when
Mehemet Ali ordered the destruction of the whole troop of
them ; so certainly a stray officer or two may have come
from the ranks, but he is a wonder. No ; such an Institu-
tion as this is a mystery, which all civilians, I suppose, had
best look at in silent wonder, and of which we must leave
the management to its professional chiefs. Their care for
their subordinates is no doubt amiable, and the gratitude
of these to their superiors must be proportionably great.
When the tipsy young Lieutenant of the 4th Dragoons cut
at his Adjutant with a sabre, he was reprimanded and re-
turned back to his duty, and does it, no doubt, very well ;
when the tipsy private struck his corporal, he was flogged,
and died after the flogging. There must be a line drawn,
look you, otherwise the poor private might have been for-
given too, by the Great Captain of the Age, who pardoned
the gentleman-offender. There must be distinctions and
differences, and mysteries which are beyond the compre-
hension of the civilian, and this paper is written as a
warning to all such not to meddle with affairs that are
quite out of their sphere.

But then there is a word, Mr. Punch declares, to be said
to other great Commanders and Field-Marshals besides the
historic Conqueror of Assaye, Vittoria, and Waterloo. We
have among us, thank Heaven ! a Field-Marshal whose baton
has been waved over fields of triumph the least sanguinary
that ever the world has known. We have an august Family
Field-Marshal, so to speak, and to him we desire humbly to
speak : —



ON THE SNOB CIVILIAN. 169

" Your Royal Highness," we say, — " your Eoyal High-
ness (who has the ear of the Head of the Army), pour into
that gracious ear the supplications of a nation. Say that
as a nation we entreat and implore that no English Chris-
tian man should any longer suffer the infernal torture of
the Cat. Say that we had rather lose a battle than flog a
soldier ; and that the courage of the Englishman will not
suffer by the loss. And if your Eoyal Highness Prince
Albert will deign to listen to this petition, we venture to
say, that you will be the most beloved of Field-Marshals,
and that you will have rendered a greater service to the
British people, and the British army, than ever was ren-
dered by any Field-Marshal since the days of Malbrook."

UN RADICAL SNOBS.




AS the principles of Punch
ar ■ ■■ "



^ __^ are eminently Conserva-
*tive, it might be thought that
anything we could say about
Radical Snobs would bear an
impress of prejudice and big-
otry, and I had thought of
letting off the poor Radical
Snobs altogether ; for persecu-
tion they had enough in for-
mer days, Heaven knows,
when to be a Radical was to
be considered a Snob, and
every flunkey who could use
his pen was accustomed to
prate about "the great un-
washed," and give himself
airs at the expense of "the
greasy multitude." But the multitude have the laugh on
their side of late years, and can listen to these pretty jokes
with good-humor.

PeAaps, after all, there is no better friend to Conserva-
tism than your outrageous Radical Snob. When a man
preaches to you that all noblemen are tyrants, that all
clergymen are hypocrites and liars, that all capitalists are
scoundrels banded together in an infamous conspiracy to
deprive the people of their rights, he creates a wholesome
revulsion of feeling in favor of the abused parties, and a
sense of fair play leads the generous heart to take a side
with the object of unjust oppression.

For instance, although I nate military flogging, as the
most brutal and odious relic we have left of the wicked tor-
turing old times, and have a private opinion tbafc officers of
crack dragoon regiments are not of necessity the very wisest
of human creatures, yet when I see Quackley the Coroner
giving himself sham airs of patriotism, and attacking the



ON RADICAL SNOBS. 171

men for the crime of the system — (of which you and I are
as much guilty as Colonel Whyte, unless we do our utmost
to get it repealed) — I find myself led over to the brow-
beaten side, and inclined to take arms against Quackley.
Yesterday, a fellow was bawling by my windows an ac-
count of the trial at Hounslow, and " the hinfamous tyranny
of a brootle and savidge Kurnal, hall to be ad for the small
charge of Won Apny.'^ Was that fellow a Radical patriot,
think you, or a Radical Snob ? and which was it that he
wanted — to put down flogging or to get money ?

What was it that made Sir Robert Peel so popular of
late days in the country ? I have no question but that it
was the attacks of certain gentlemen in the House of Com-
mons. Now they have left off abusing him, somehow we
are leaving off loving him. Nay, he made a speech last
week, about the immorality of lotteries and the wickedness
of Art-Unions, which caused some kind friends to say —
"Why, the man is just as fond of humbug and solemn cant
as ever."

This is the use that Radical Snobs, or all political Snobs,
are made for, — to cause honest folk to rally over to the
persecuted side ; and I often think, that if the world goes
on at its present rate — the people carrying all before them ;
the aristocracy always being beaten after the ignominious
simulacrum of a battle ; the Church bowled down ; the
revolution triumphant ; and (who knows ?) the monarchy
shaken — I often think old Punch will find himself in op-
position as usual, and deploring the good old days and the
advent of Radicalism along with poor old Mrs. Gamp and
Mrs. Harris.

Perhaps the most dangerous specimen of the Radical
Snob to be found in the three kingdoms is that branch of
Snobs called Young Ireland, who have been making a huge
pother within the last fortnight, and who have found a
good deal of favor in this country of late years.

I don't know why we have been so fond of this race : ex-
cept that it wrote pretty poems, and murdered the Saxons
in melodious iambics, and got a character for being honest
somehow, in opposition to old Mr. O'Connell, to whom the
English prejudice denied that useful quality. We are fond
of anything strange here, and perhaps our taste is not
very classical. We like Tom Thumb ; we like the Yankee
melodists ; we like the American Indians ; and we like
the Irish howl. Young Ireland has howled to considerable



172 ''SNOB'* PAPERS.

effect in this country ; and the " Shan Van Voght," and
the " Men of '98," have been decidedly popular. If the
O'Brien, and the O'Toole, and the O'Dowd, and the
O'Whack, and the Mulholligan would take Saint James's
Theatre, the war-cry of Aodh O'Nyal and the Battle of the
Blackwater, and the Galloglass Chorus might bring in a
little audience even in the hot weather.

But this I know, that if any party ever fulfilled the con-
dition of Snobs, Young Ireland has. Is ludicrous conceit
Snobbishness ? Is absurd arrogance peevish ill-temper,
utter weakness accompanied by tremendous braggadocity.
Snobbishness ? Is Tibbs a Snob or not ? When the little
creature threatens to thrash Tom Cribb; and when Tom,
laughing over his great broad shoulders, walks good-hu-
moredly away, is Tibbs a Snob, who stands yelling after
him and abusing him, — or a hero, as he fancies himself
to be?

A martyr without any persecutors is an utter Snob ; a
frantic dwarf who snaps his fingers (as close as he can lift
them) under the nose of a peaceable giant, is a Snob ; and
the creature becomes a most wicked and dangerous Snob
when he gets the ear of people more ignorant than himself,
inflames them with lies, and misleads them into ruin.
Young Ireland shrieking piteously with nobody hurting
him, or waving his battle-axed hand on his battlemented
wall, and bellowing his war-cry of Bug-Aboo — and roaring
out melodramatic tomfoolery — and fancying himself a
champion and a hero, is only a ludicrous little humbug;
but when he finds people to believe his stories, that the
liberated Americans are ready to rally round the green
banner of Erin — that the battalioned invincibility of
France is hastening to succor the enemy of the Saxon, he
becomes a Snob so dangerous and malevolent, that Mr.
Punch loses his usual jocularity in regarding him, and
would see him handed over to proper authorities without
any ill-timed compassion.

It was this braggart violence of soul that roused the
Punchine wrath against Mr. O'Connell, when, mustering
his millions upon the green hills of Erin, he uttered those
boasts and menaces which he is now proceeding, rather de-
murely, to swallow. And as for pitying the Young Ire-
landers any longer because they are so honest, because they
write such pretty verses, because they would go to the scaf-
fold for their opinions — our hearts are not tender enough



ON RADICAL SNOBS. 178

for this kind of commiseration. A set of young gentlemen
might choose to publish a paper advocating arson, or point-
ing out the utility of murder — a regard for our throats and
our property would lead us not to pity these interesting
young patriots too tenderly ; and we have no more love for
Young Ireland and her leaders and their schemes, than for
regenerate England under the maiiiyrs Thistlewood and
Ings.

THE PROSER:

E8SATB AND DISGOUBSES BT DR. SOLOHOH PACIFICO.

ON A GOOD-LOOKING YOUNG LADY.

OME time ago I had the
fortune to witness at
the house of Erminia's
brother a rather pretty
and affecting scene:
whereupon, bb my cus-
tom ia, I would like to
make a few moral re-
marks. I must premise
that I knew Erminia's
family loi^ before the
youi^ lady waa bom.
Victorina her mother,
Boa her aunt, Chinchilla
her grandmother — I
have been intimate with
every one of these lar
dies : and at the table of
Sabilla, her married sis-
ter, witii whom Erminia
lives, have a cover laid

for me whenever I choose to ask for it.
Everybody who has once seen Erminia remembers her.

Fate is beneficent to a man before whose eyes at the parks,




ON A GOOD-LOOKING YOUNG LADY. 175

or churches, or theatres, or public or private assemblies it
throws Erminia. To see her face is a personal kindness
for which one ought to be thankful to Fortune ; who might
have shown you Caprella, with her whiskers, or Felissa,
with her savage eyes, instead of the calm and graceful, the
tender and beautiful Erminia. When she comes into the
room, it is like a beautiful air of Mozart breaking upon
you : when she passes through a ball-room, everybody tiins
and asks who is that Princess, that fairy lady ? Even the
women, especially those who are the most beautiful them-
selves, admire her. By one of those kind freaks of favor-
itism which Nature takes, she has endowed this young lady
with almost every kind of perfection : has given her a
charming face, a perfect form, a pure heart, a fine percep-
tion and wit, a pretty sense of humor, a laugh and a voice
that are as sweet as music to hear, for innocence and ten-
derness ring in every accent, and a grace of movement
which is a curiosity to watch, for in every attitude of mo-
tion or repose her form moves or settles into beauty, so that
a perpetual grace accompanies her. I have said before that
I am an old fogy. On the day that I leave off admiring, I
hope I shall die. To see Erminia, is not to fall in love
with her : there are some women too handsome, as it were,
for that : and I would as soon think of making myself mis-
erable because I could not marry the moon, and make the
silver-bowed goddess Diana Mrs. Pacifico, as I should think
of having any personal aspirations towards Miss Erminia.

Well then, it happened the other day that this almost
peerless creature, on a visit to the country, met that great
poet Timotheus, whose habitation is not far from the coun-
try house of Erminia's friend, and who, upon seeing the
young lady, felt for her that admiration which every man
of taste experiences upon beholding her, and which, if Mrs.
Timotheus had not been an exceedingly sensible woman,
would have caused jealousy between her and the great bard
her husband. But, charming and beautiful herself, Mrs.
Timotheus can even pardon another woman for being so ;
nay, with perfect good sense, though possibly with a little
factitious enthusiasm, she professes to share to its fullest
extent the admiration of the illustrious Timotheus for the
young beauty.

After having made himself well acquainted with Er-

from such a poet under sucli circumstances, and began to
sing. This is the way in which Nature has provided that
poets should express their emotions. When they see a
beautiful creature they straightway fall to work with their
ten syllables and eight syllables, with duty rhyming with
beauty, vernal to eternal, riddle to fiddle, or what you
please, and turn out to the best of their ability, and with
great pains and neatness on their own part, a copy of verses
in praise of the adorable object. I myself may have a doubt
about the genuineness of the article produced, or of the
passion which vents itself in this way, for how can a man
who has to assort carefully his tens and eights, to make his
epithets neat and melodious, to hunt here and there for
rhymes, and to bite the tip of his pen, or pace the gravel
walk in front of his house searching for ideas — I doubt, I
say, how a man who must go through the above process be-
fore turning out a decent set of verses, can be actuated by
such strong feeling as you and I, when, in the days of our
youth, with no particular preparation, but with our hearts
full of manly ardor, and tender and respectful admiration,
we went to the Saccharissa for the time being, and poured
out our souls at her feet. That sort of eloquence comes
spontaneously ; that poetry does n't require rhyme-jingling
and metre-sorting, but rolls out of you you don't know how,
as much, perhaps, to your own surprise as to that of the
beloved object whom you address. In my time, I know
whenever I began to make verses about a woman, it was
when my heart was no longer very violently smitten about
her, and the verses were a sort of mental dram and artificial
stimulus with which a man worked himself up to represent
enthusiasm and perform passion. Well, well ; I see what
you mean, I am jealous of him. Timotheus's verses were
beautiful, that's the fact — confound him ! — and I wish I
could write as well, or half as well indeed, or do anything
to give Erminia pleasure. Like an honest man and faith-
ful servant, he went and made the best thing he could, and
laid his offering at Beauty's feet. What can a gentleman
do more ? My dear Mrs. Pacifico here remarks that I
never made her a copy of verses. Of course not, my love.
I am not a verse-making man, nor are you that sort of ob-
ject — that sort of target, I may say — at which, were I a
poet, I Avould choose to discharge those winged shafts of
Apollo.
When Erminia got the verses and read them, she laid

them down, and with one of the prettiest and most affect-
ing emotions which I ever saw in my life, she began to cry
a little. The verses of course were full of praises of her
beauty. " They all tell me that," she said ; " nobody cares
for anything but that," cried the gentle and sensitive crea-
ture, feeling within that she had a thousand accomplish-
ments, attractions, charms, which her hundred thousand
lovers would not see, whilst they were admiring her mere
outward figure and head-piece.

I once heard of another lady, "de par le monde," as
honest Des Bourdeilles says, who after looking at her plain
face in the glass, said, beautifully and pathetically, " I am
sure I should have made a good wife to any man, if he
could but have got over my face ! " and bewailing her
maidenhood in this touching and artless manner, saying
that she had a heart full of love, if anybody would accept
it, full of faith and devotion, could she but find some man
on whom to bestow it ; she but echoed the sentiment which
I have mentioned above, and which caused in the pride of
her beauty the melancholy of the lonely and victorious
beauty. "We are full of love and kindness, ye men!"
each says ; " of truth and purity. We don't care about
your good looks. Could we but find the right man, the
man who loved us for ourselves, we would endow him with
all the treasures of our hearts, and devote our lives to make
him happy." I admire and reverence Erminia's tears, and
the simple heart-stricken plaint of the other forsaken lady.
She is Jephthah's daughter condemned by no fault of her
own, but doomed by Fate to disappear from among women.
The other is a queen in her splendor to whom all the Lords
and Princes bow down and pay worship. " Ah ! " says she,
" it is to the Queen you are kneeling, all of you. I am a
woman under this crown and this ermine. I want to be
loved, and not to be worshipped : and to be allowed to love
is given to everybody but me."

How much finer a woman's nature is than a man's (by an
ordinance of Nature for the purpose no doubt devised), how
much purer and less sensual than ours, is in that fact so
consoling to misshapen men, to ugly men, to little men, to
giants, to poor men, to men scarred with the small-pox, or
ever so ungainly or unfortunate — that their ill-looks or
mishaps don't influence women regarding them, and that
the awkwardest fellow has a chance for a prize. Whereas,
when we, brutes that we are, enter a room, we sidle up natu-

rally towards the prettiest woman ; it is the pretty face ^nd
figure that attracts us ; it is not virtue, or merit, or mental
charms, be they ever so great. When one reads the fairy
tale of Beauty and the Beast, no one is at all surprised at
Beauty's being moved by Beast's gallantry and devotion
and true-heartedness, and rewarding him with her own love
at last. There was hardly any need of making him a lovely
young prince in a gold dress under his horns and bearskin.
Beast as he was, but good Beast, loyal Beast, brave, affec-
tionate, upright, generous, enduring Beast, she would have
loved his ugly mug without any attraction at all. It is
her nature to do so, God bless her ! It was a man made
the story, one of those two-penny-halfpenny men-milliner
moralists, who think that to have a handsome person and
a title are the greatest gifts of fortune, and that a man is
not complete unless he is a lord and has glazed boots. Or
it may have been that the transformation alluded to did not
actually take place, but was only spiritual and in Beauty's
mind, and that, seeing before her loyalty, bravery, truth,
and devotion, they became in her eyes lovely, and that
she hugged her Beast with a perfect contentment to the
end.

When ugly Wilkes said that he was only a quarter of an
hour behind the handsomest man in England, meaning that
the charms of his conversation would make him in that
time at a lady's side as agreeable and fascinating as a beau,
what a compliment he paid the whole sex ! How true it is,
(not of course applicable to you, my dear reader and lucky
dog who possess both wit and the most eminent personal
attractions, but of the world in general,) — we look for
Beauty : women for Love.

So, fair Erminia, dry your beautiful eyes and submit to
your lot, and to that adulation which all men pay you ; in
the midst of which court of yours the sovereign must per-
force be lonely. That solitude is a condition of your life,
my dear young lady, which many would like to accept ; nor
will your dominion last much longer than my Lord Fam-
combe's, let us say, at the Mansion House, whom Time and
the inevitable November will depose. Another potentate
will ascend his throne : the toast-master will proclaim an-
other name than his, and the cup will be pledged to an-
other health. As with Xerxes and all his courtiers and
army at the end of a few years, as with the flowers of the
field, as with Lord Farncombe, so with Erminia : were I

Timotheus of the tuneful choir, I might follow out this
simile between Lord Mayors and Beauties, and with smooth
rhymes and quaint antithesis make a verse offering to my
fair young lady. But, Madam, your faithful Pacifico is not
a poet, only a proser ; and it is in truth, and not in numbers,
that he admires you.

ON AN INTEEESTING FEENCH EXILE.

AS lie walks the streets of London in this present season,
everybody must have remarked the constant appear-
ance in all thoroughfares and public places of very many
well-dressed foreigners. With comely beards, variegated
neck-cloths, and varnished little boots, with guide-books in
their hands, or a shabby guide or conductor accompanying
a smart little squad of half-a-dozen of them, these honest
Continentals march through the city and its environs, ex-
amine Nelson on his indescribable pillar, the Duke of York
impaled between the Athenaeum and the United Service
Clubs — les docks, le tunnel (monument du genie Frangais),
Greenwich avec son jpa7*c et ses whites-bates, les monuments
de la cite, les Squares du West End, etc. The sight of these
peaceful invaders is a very pleasant one. One would like
to hear their comments upon our city and institutions, and
to be judged by that living posterity; and I have often
thought that an ingenious young Englishman, such as there
are many now amongst us, possessing the two languages
perfectly, would do very well to let his beard grow, and to
travel to Paris, for the purpose of returning thence with a
company of excursionists, who arrive to pass une semaine
a Londres, and of chronicling the doings and opinions of
the party. His excellency the Nepaulese Ambassador, and
Lieutenant Futty Jung, know almost as much about our
country as many of those other foreigners who live but four
hours' distance from us, and who are transported to Eng-
land and back again at the cost of a couple of hundred
francs. They are conducted to our theatres, courts of jus-
tice. Houses of Parliament, churches ; not understanding,
for the most part, one syllable of what they hear: their
eager imaginations fancy an oration or a dialogue, which
supplies the words delivered by the English speakers, and re-
places them by figures and sentiments of their own faqon ;
and they believe, no doubt, that their reports are pretty ac-
curate, and that they have actually heard and understood
something.



ON AN INTERESTING FRENCH EXILE. 181

To see the faces of these good folks of a Sunday — their
dreary bewilderment and puzzled demeanor as they walk
the blank streets (if they have not the means of flight to
Richemont or Amstedd, or some other pretty environs of
the town where gazon is plentiful and ale cheap), is always
a most queer and comic sight. Has not one seen that pecu-
liar puzzled look in certain little amusing manikins at the
Zoological Gardens and elsewhere, when presented with a
nut which they can't crack, or examining a looking-glass of
which they can't understand the mystery — that look so
delightfully piteous and ludicrous ? I do not mean to say
that all Frenchmen are like the active and ingenious ani-
mals alluded to, and make a simious comparison odious to
a mighty nation ; this, in the present delicate condition of the
diplomatic relations between the two countries, and while
Lord Stanley's questions are pending respecting papers which
have reference to the affairs of a celebrated namesake of
mine,* would be a dangerous and unkind simile ; but that,
as our proverbial dullness and ferocity often shows itself in
the resemblance between the countenances of our people
and our houles-dogues, so the figure and motions of the
Frenchman bear an occasional likeness to the lively ring-
tail, or the brisk and interesting marmoset. They can't
crack any of our nuts ; an impenetrable shell guards them
from our friends' teeth. I saw last year, at Paris, a little
play caUed " Une Semaine k Londres," intending to ridicule
the amusements of the excursionists, and, no doubt, to
satirize the manners of the English. Very likely the author
had come to see London — so had M. Gautier — so had M.
Valentino — the first of whom saw " vases chiselled by
Benvenuto " in the pot from which Mrs. Jones at Clapham
poured out the poet's tea ; the second, from a conversation
in English, of which he didn't understand a syllable, with
a young man in Messrs. Hunt and Roskell's shop, found
out that the shopman was a Red Republican, and that he
and most of his fellows were groaning under the tyranny of
the aristocracy. Very likely, we say, the author of " Une
Semaine k Londres" had travelled hither. There is no
knowing what he did not see : he saw the barge of the
Queen pulling to Greenwich, whither her Majesty was
going to manger un excellent sandwidg ; he saw the bateaux

of the hlanchisseuses on the river ; and with these and a
hundred similar traits, he strove to paint our manners in
behalf of his countrymen.

I was led into the above, and indeed the ensuing reflec-
tions, by reading an article in the Times newspaper last week,
on Citizen Ledru RoUin's work on the decadence of this
unhappy country ; and by a subsequent frequent reference
to the work itself. That great citizen protests that he has
cracked the British nut, and having broken his grinders at it,
pronounces the kernel utterly poisonous, bitter, and rotten.
No man since the days of Pittetcobourg has probably cursed
us with a more hearty ill-will — not O'Connell himself
(whom the ex-tribune heartily curses and abuses too) abused
us more in his best days. An enthusiastic malevolence, a
happy instinct for blundering, an eye that naturally dis-
torts the objects which its bloodshot glances rest upon, and
a fine natural ignorance, distinguish the prophet who came
among us when his own country was too hot to hold him,
and who bellows out to us his predictions of hatred and
ruin. England is an assassin and corrupter (roars out our
friend) ; it has nailed Ireland to the cross (this is a fa-
vorite image of the orator ; he said, two years ago in Paris,
that he was nailed to the cross for the purpose of saving the
nation !) ; that, while in France the press is an apostleship,
in England it is a business ; that the Church is a vast aristo-
cratic corporation, the Prelate of Canterbury having three
million francs of revenue, and the Bishop of Hawkins hav-
ing died worth six millions two hundred and fifty thou-
sand ; that the commercial aristocracy is an accursed power,
making "Rule Britannia'' resound in distant seas, from
the height of its victorious masts ; and so forth. I am not
going to enter into an argument or quarrel with the ac-
curacy of details so curious — my purpose in writing is that
of friendly negotiator and interposer of good offices, and
my object eminently pacific.

But though a man paints an odious picture, and writes
beneath it, as the boys do, " This is England," that is no
reason that the portrait should be like. Mr. Spec, for in-
stance, who tried to draw Erminia as a figure-head for the
Proser of last week, made a face which was no more like
hers than it was like mine ; and how should he, being him-
self but a wretched performer, and having only once seen
the young lady, at an exhibition, where I pointed her out ?
As with Spec and Erminia, so with Ledru and Britannia



ON AN INTERESTING FRENCH EXILE. 183

I doubt whether the Frenchman has ever seen at all the dear
old country of ours which he reviles and curses and abuses.

How is Ledru to see England ? We may wager that he
does not know a word of the language, any more than nine
hundred and ninety-nine of a thousand Frenchmen. What
do they want with Jordan when they have Abana and Phar-
par, rivers of Damascus, which they consider to be the finest
and most cleansing waters of the world ? In the reader's
acquaintance with Frenchmen, how many does he know
who can speak our language decently ? I have for my
part, and for example, seen many of the refugees whom the
troubles of '48 sent over among us, and not met one who, in
the couple of years' residence, has taken the trouble to
learn our language tolerably, who can understand it accu-
rately when spoken, much more express himseK in it with
any fluency. And without any knowledge of Mr. RoUin,
who blunders in every page of his book, who does not make
the least allusion to our literature, one may pretty surely
argue that this interesting exile does not know our lan-
guage, and could not construe, without enormous errors,
any half-Brdozen sentences in the Times. When Macaulay
was busy with his great chapters on King William, he
thoroughly learned Dutch, in order to understand, and have
at first-hand, the despatches of the Prince of Orange. Have
you heard of many Frenchmen swallowing a language or
two before they thought of producing a history ? Can
Thiers read a page of Napier ? No more than Ledru can,
or communicate in our native language with any English-
man, of any party, from Lord John Manners to Mr. Julian
Harney.

How many houses has Ledru visited of the ruffian aristo-
crats who are plundering the people, of the priests who are
cheating them, of the middle classes who are leagued with
the aristocracy, or of the people themselves ? Is he inti-
mate with any three English families ? with any single
nobleman, with any one parson, tradesman, or working-
man ? He quotes a great mass of evidence against Eng-
land from the Morning Chronicle : did he translate from
the Chronicle himself, or get a secretary ? Can he trans-
late ? If he will, without the aid of a dictionary, sit down
in our office and translate this paper fairly into French, he
shall have the last volume of Punch, gilt, presented to him
gratis.

The chances are that this exile never sees our societ^'^ at
all ; that he gets his dinner at a French tahle-d^hote, where

other unfortunates of bis nation meet and eat and grumble ;

Frencbmen, to read tbe French newspapers ; tbat be buys
bis cigars at a Frencb bouse ; tbat be takes bis walk be-
tween tbe Quadrant and Leicester Square ; that be takes
his amusement at tbe Frencb play, or at an hotel in Lei-
cester Place where there is a billiard- and a smoking-room,
and where the whiskered Red men can meet and curse rin-
fame Angleterre.

Marius sitting in the ruins of Carthage and scowling on
his pursuers, is a grand figure enough ; but a French tri-
bune looking upon our Carthage, standing alone we may
fancy against the desolate statue yonder in Leicester
Square, is the most dismal, absurd, ludicrous image imagin-
able. " Thou hireling soldier '' (says he, folding his arms
against the statue and knitting his brows with an awful
air), " thou shuddering Cimbrian slave, tell thy master that
thou hast seen Caius Marius, banished and a fugitive,
seated on the ruins of," etc. The minion of despots whom
he addresses d9es not care in tbe least about his scowls, or
his folded arms, or his speech ; not he — Policeman X
points with his staff, thinks within himself that it's only a
Frenchman, and tells him to move on.

To an exile of this sort what a daily humiliation London
must be! How small be appears amongst tbe two mil-
lions ! Who the deuce cares for him ? The Government
does not even pay him the compliment of the slightest per-
secution, or set so much as a spy or a policeman as a guard
of honor at bis door. Every man he meets of the two
millions has his own business to mind. Yonder man can't
attend to Marius : he is Cbowler, and has got to " chaw
up " Peel. The next can't listen : he is Cobden, who is so
pressed tbat he cannot even receive Captain Aaron Smith,
who has something particular to say to him. A third is
engaged : it is Lord Ashley, who has the bettering of the
working classes at heart, and tbe model houses to visit. A
fourth gives Marius a little sympathy, but must pass on : it
is Mr. G. W. M. Reynolds, author of "Tbe Mysteries of
London" and "The People's Instructor," who is going to
beard Lord John at tbe meeting, and ask his lordship what
his lordship is going to do for the millions ? One and all
they have their own affairs to mind. Who cares about
Marius ? Get along, Marius, and play a pool at billiards,
and smoke a cigar, and curse England to the other braves.
Move on, Marius, and don't block up the way.

ON AN AMERICAN TEAVELLER.

S you sit in the great drawing-room at the Megathe-
_ rium, or any other club, I dare say you will remark
that as each man passes the great mirror in the middle room,
be he ever so handsome or homely, so well or ill dressed, so
hurried or busy, he nevertheless has time for a good sur-
vey of himself in the glass, and a deliberate examination of
his clothes and person. He is anxious to know what the
glass thinks of him. We are anxious to know what all re-
flective persons think of us. Hence our constant pleasure
in reading books of travel by foreigners : by Hadji Babas
and Persian Princes ; by Ledru Rollins or German philoso-
phers ; by Americans who come to England ; and the like.
If the black gentleman in Saint Paul's Churchyard, who
was called away from his broom the other day and lifted
up into the Nepaulese General's carriage in the quality of
interpreter, writes his account of London life, its crossings
and sweepings, I have no doubt we shall all read it ; and as
for the Americans, I think a smart publisher might bring
over a traveller from the States every season, at least, so
constant is our curiosity regarding ourselves, so pleased are
we to hear ourselves spoken of, of such an unfailing inter-
est are We to Us.

Thus, after reading Ledru Rollings book the other day,
and taking the dismal view supplied of ourselves by that
cracked and warped and dingy old estaminet looking-glass,
I, for one, was glad to survey my person in such a bright
and elegant New York mirror as that of Mr. Parker Willis ;
and seized eagerly, at a railway station, upon a new volume
by that gentleman, bearing the fascinating title of ^^ People
I have Met." Parker Willis is no other than that famous
and clever N. P. Willis of former days, whose reminis-
cences have delighted so many of us, and in whose com-
pany one is always sure to find amusement of some sort or
the other. Sometimes it is amusement at the writer's wit
and smartness, his brilliant descriptions and wondrous flow
and rattle of spirits ; sometimes it is wicked amusement,



186 ^'PROSER'' PAPERS.

and, it must be confessed, at Willis's own expense — amuse-
ment at the immensity of N. P.'s blunders, amusement at
the prodigiousness of his self-esteem ; amusement always,
with him or at him ; with or at Willis the poet, Willis the
man, Willis the dandy, Willis the lover — now the Broad-
way Crichton, once the ruler of fashion, and heart-enslaver
of Bond Street, and the Boulevard, and the Corso and the
Chiaja, and the Constantinople Bazaar. It is well for the
general peace of families that the world does not produce
many such men ; there would be no keeping our wives and
daughters in their senses were such fascinators to make fre-
quent apparitions amongst us ; but it is comfortable that
there should have been a Willis ; and (since the appearance
of the Proser) a literary man myself, and anxious for the
honor of that profession, I am proud to think that a man
of our calling should have come, should have seen, should
have conquered, as Willis has done.

"There is more or less of truth," he nobly says, "in
every one of the stories," which he narrates here in " Peo-
ple I have Met " — more or less, to be sure there is — and
it is on account of this more or less of truth that I, for my
part, love and applaud this hero and poet so ; and recom-
mend every man who reads Punch to lay out a shilling and
read Willis. We live in our country and don't know it ;
Willis walks into it and dominates it at once. To know a
Duchess, for instance, is given to very few of us. He sees
things that are not given to us to see. We see the Duchess
pass by in her carriage, and gaze with much reverence on
the strawberry leaves on the panels and her grace within ;
whereas the odds are that that lovely Duchess has had one
time or the other a desperate flirtation with Willis the
Conqueror: perhaps she is thinking of him at this very
minute as her jewelled hand presses her perfumed cambric
handkerchief to her fair and coroneted brow, and she lan-
guidly stops to purchase a ruby bracelet at Gunter's, or to
sip an ice at Howell and James's. He must have whole
mattresses stuffed with the blond, or raven, or auburn
memories of England's fairest daughters. When the female
English aristocracy read this title of " People I have Met,"
I can fancy the whole female peerage of Willis's time in a
shudder : and the melancholy Marchioness, and the aban-
doned Countess, and the heart-stricken Baroness, trembling
as each gets the volume, and asking of her guilty conscience,
" Gracious goodness ! is the monster going to show up me ? "



ON AN AMERICAN TEA VELLER, 187

" The greater number of his stories," Willis says, " em-
body such passages in the personal history of the eminent
men and women of Europe as the author came to the knowl-
edge of, by conversance with the circles in which they
moved " — and this is the point, rather than their own live-
liness, elegance of style, and intrinsic merit, which makes
them so valuable to English readers. We can't hope for
the facilities accorded to him. As at Paris, by merely
exhibiting his passport, a foreigner will walk straight into
an exhibition which is only visible to a native on certain
days in the year ; so with English aristocratic society, to be
admitted into that Elysium you had best be a stranger.
Indeed, how should it be otherwise ? A lady of fashion,
however benevolently disposed, can't ask everybody to her
house in Grosvenor Square or Carlton Gardens. Say there
are five hundred thousand people in London (a moderate
calculation) who have heard of Lady P.'s Saturday even-
ing parties and would like to attend them : where could
her ladyship put the thousandth part of them ? We on
the outside must be content to hear at second hand of the
pleasures which the initiated enjoy.

With strangers it is different, and they claim and get ad-
mittance as strangers. Here, for instance, is an account of
one Brown, an American (though under that modest mask
of Brown I can't help fancying that I see the features of
an N. P. W. himself) ; Brown arrived in London with a
budget of introductions like the postman's bag on Valen-
tine's Day ; he " began with a most noble Duke " (the sly
rogue), and, of course, was quickly " on the dinner-list of
most of the patricians of Mayfair."

"As I was calling myself to account the other day over my breakfast,"
said Brown, filling his glass, and pushing the bottle, " it occurred to me
that my round of engagements required some little variation. There's a
ioujours perdrix even among lords and ladies, particularly when you be-
long as much to their sphere, and are as likely to become a part of it, as
the fly revolving in aristocratic dust on the wheel of my lord's carriage.
I thought, perhaps, I had better see some other sort of people.

" I had, under a presse-paptpr on the table, about a hundred letters of
introduction — the condemned remainder, after the selection, by advice, of
four or five only. I determined to cut this heap like a pack of cards and
follow np the trump.

** * John Mimpson, Esquire, House q/*Mimpson and Phipps, Mark Lane,
London.''

" The gods had devoted me to the acquaintance of Mr. fand probably
Mrs.) John Mimpson."

After a " dialogue of accost," Brown produced his intra



188 '^PROSER'* PAPERS,

ductory letter to Mimpson, whom lie finely describes as
having that " highly-washed look peculiar to London City
men ; " and Mimpson asked Brown to lunch and sleep at
his villa at Hampstead the next day, whither the American
accordingly went in a " poshay " with " a pair of Newman's
posters." Brown might, as he owns, have performed this
journey in an omnibus for sixpence, whereas the chaise
would cost four dollars at least ; but the stranger preferred
the more costly and obsolete contrivance.

" Mrs. Mimpson was in the garden. The dashing footman who gave
me the information led me through a superh drawing-room, and out at a
glass door upon the lawn, and left me to make my own way to the lady's
presence.

" It was a delicious spot, and I should have been very glad to ramble
about by myself till dinner ; but, at a turn in the grand waB^, I came sud-
denly upon two ladies.

" I made my bow, and begged leave to introduce myself as * Mr. Brown.*

" With a very slight inclination of the head, and no smile whatever, one
of the ladies asked me if I had walked from town, and begged her com-
panion (without introducing me to her) to show me in to lunch. The
Bpokester was a stout and tall woman, who had rather an aristocratic nose,
and was not handsome ; but, to give her her due, she had made a narrow
escape of it. She was dressed very showily, and evidently had great pre-
tensions ; but that she was not at all glad to see Mr. Brown was as ap-
parent as was at all necessary. As the other and younger lady who was
^o accompany me, however, was very pretty, though dressed very plainly,
and had, withal, a look in her eye which assured me she was amused with
my unwelcome apparition, I determined, as I should not otherwise have
done, to stay it out, and accepted her convoy with submissive civility —
very much inclined, however, to be impudent to somebody, somehow.

"The lunch was on a tray in a side room, and I rang the bell and or-
dered a bottle of champagne. The servant looked surprised, but brought
it, and meantime I was getting through the weather, and the other com-
monplaces, and the lady, saying little, was watching me very calmly. I
liked her looks, however, and was sure she was not a Mimpson.

" * Hand this to Miss Armstrong,' said I to the footman, pouring out a
glass of champagne.

" * Miss Bellamy, you mean, sir.'

" I rose and bowed, and, with as grave a curtsey as I could command,
expressed my pleasure at my first introduction to Miss Bellamy —through
Thomas the footman ! Miss Bellamy burst into a laugh, and was pleased
to compliment my American manners, and in ten minutes we were a very
merry pair of friends, and she accepted my arm for a stroll through the
grounds, carefully avoiding the frigid neighborhood of Mrs. Mimpson."

There's a rascal for you ! He enters a house, is received
coolly by the mistress (and if Mrs. Mimpson had to receive
every Brown in London — ye gods ! what was she to do ?),
walks into chicken fixings in a side room, and, not content
with Mimpson's sherry, calls for a bottle of champagne —
not for a glass of champagne, but for a bottle ; he catches



ON AN AMERICAN TRAVELLER. 189

hold of it and pours out for himself, the rogue, and for
Miss Bellamy, to whom Thomas introduces him. And this
upon an introduction of five years' date, from one mercan-
tile man to another ; upon an introduction, one of a thousand
which lucky Brown possesses, and on the strength of which
Brown sneers at Mimpson, sneers at Mrs. M., sneers at M.'s
sherry, makes a footman introduce him to a lady, and con-
sumes a bottle of champagne ! Come, Brown ! you are a
stranger, and on the dinner-list of most of the patricians of
Mayfair ; but isn't this un peu fort, my boy ? If Mrs.
Mimpson, who is described as a haughty lady, fourth cousin
of a Scotch Earl, and marrying M. for his money merely,
had suspicions regarding the conduct of her husband's
friends, don't you see that this sort of behavior on your
part, my dear Brown, was not likely to do away with Mrs.
M.'s little prejudices ? I should not like a stranger to
enter my house, pooh-pooh my Marsala, order my servant
about, and desire an introduction to my daughter through
him ; and deferentially think. Brown, that you had no right
to be impudent somehow to somebody, as in this instance
you certainly were.

The upshot of the story is, that Mrs. M. was dying to take
her daughter to Almack's, for which place of entertainment
Brown, through one of the patronesses, Lady X., " the best
friend he has," could get as many tickets as he wished ; and
that, to punish Mrs. Mimpson for her rudeness, and reward
Miss Bellamy for her kindness. Brown got tickets for Miss
Bellamy and her mamma, but would get never a ticket for
Miss Mimpson and hers — a wonderful story, truly, and
with a wonderful moral.



"PROSER" PAPERS.




ON THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC.

Y rising young friend
Hitchings, the author
of "Randolph the
Robber," "The Mur-
derers of May fair,"
and other romances,
and one of the chief
writers in the Lietor
newspaper — a highly
liberal, nay aeven-
leagued-boots pro-
gressional journal, was
discoursing with the
writer of the present
- --^=^^-,^^^zr^ - — time upon the queer

decision to which the
French Assembly has come, and which enforces a signature
henceforth to all the leading articles in the French papers.
As an act of Government, Hitchings said he thought the
measure most absurd and tyrannous, but he was not sorry
for it, as it would infallibly increase the importance of the
profession of letters, to which we both belonged. The man of
letters will no longer be the anonymous slave of the news-
paper-press proprietor, Hitchings said ; the man of letters
will no longer be used and flung aside in his old days ; he will
be rewarded according to his merits, and have the chance of
making himself a name. And then Hitchings spoke with
great fervor regarding the depressed condition of literary
men, and said the time was coming when their merits would
get them their own.

On this latter subject, which is a favorite one with many
gentlemen of our profession, I, for one, am confessedly in-
credulous. I am resolved not to consider myself a martyr.
I never knew a man who had written a book (unless,
indeed, it were a Barrister with Attorneys) hurt his posi-

tion in society by having done so. On the contraiy, a
clever writer, with decent manners and conduct, makes
more friends than any other man. And I do not believe
(parenthetically) that it will make much difference to my
friend Hitchings whether his name is affixed to one, twenty,
or two thousand articles of his composition. But what
' would happen in England if such a regulation as that just
passed in France were to become law ; and the House of
Commons omnipotent, which can shut up our parks for us,
which can shut up our post-office for us, which can do any-
thing it will, should take a fancy to have the signature of
every writer of a newspaper article ?

Have they got any secret ledger at the Times in which
the names of the writers of all the articles in that journal
are written down ? That would be a curious book to see.
Articles in that paper have been attributed to every great
man of the day : at one time it was said that Brougham
wrote regularly, at another Canning was a known con-
tributor, at some other time it was Sir Robert Peel, Lord
Aberdeen. It would be curious to see the real names. The
Chancellor's or the Foreign Secretary's articles would most
likely turn out to be written by Jones or Smith. I mean
no disrespect to the latter, but the contrary — to be a writer
for a newspaper requires more knowledge, genius, readiness,
scholarship, than you want in St. Stephen's. Compare a
good leading ai*ticle and a speech in the House of Com-
mons, — compare a House of Commons orator with a writer,
pshaw !

Would Jones or Smith, however, much profit by the pub-
lication of their names to their articles ? That is doubt-
ful. When the Chronicle or the Times speaks now, it is
" we " who are speaking, we the Liberal Conservatives, we
the Conservative Sceptics ; when Jones signs the article,
it is we no more, but Jones. It goes to the public with
no authority. The public does not care very much what
Jones's opinions are. They don't purchase the Jones organ
any more — the paper droops ; and in fact I can conceive
nothing more wearisome than to see the names of Smith,
Brown, Jones, Robinson, and so forth, written in capitals
every day, day after day, under the various articles of the
paper. The public would begin to cry out at the poverty
of the literary dramatis personse. We have had Brown
twelve times this month, it would say. That Robinson's
name is always coming up. As soon as there is a finance



192 ^'PROSER'' PAPERS.

question, or a foreign question, or what not, it is Smith
who signs the article. Give us somebody else.

Thus Brown and Eobinson would get a doubtful and pre-
carious bread instead of the comfortable and regular engage-
ment which they now have. The paper would not be what
it is. It would be impossible to employ men on trial, and
see what their talents were worth. Occasion is half a pub-
lic writer's battle. To sit down in his study and compose
an article that might be suitable, is a hard work for him :
twice as hard as the real work ; and yet not the real work ;
which is to fight the battle at two hours' notice, at the
given place and time. The debate is over at twelve o'clock
at night, let us say. Mr. Editor looks round, and fixes on
his man. "Now's your time. Captain Smith," says he;
" charge the enemy and rout them ! " or, " Advance, Colonel
Jones, with your column and charge."

Now there may be men who are Jones's or Robinson's
superiors in intellect, and who — give them a week or ten
days to prepare — would turn out such an article as neither
of the two men named could ever have produced — that
is very likely. I have often, for my part, said the most
brilliant thing in the world, and one that would utterly
upset that impudent Jenkins, whose confounded jokes and
puns spare nobody ; but then it has been three hours after
Jenkins's pun, when I was walking home very likely. And
so it is with writers : some of them possess the amazing
gift of the impromptu, and can always be counted on in
a moment of necessity ; whilst others, slower coaches or
leaders, require to get all their heavy guns into position,
and laboriously to fortify their camp, before they begin to
fire.

Now, saying that Robinson is the fellow chiefly to be
intrusted with the quick work of the paper, it would be a
most unkind and unfair piece of tyranny on the newspaper
proprietor to force him to publish Robinson's name as the
author of all the articles on occasion. You have no more
right to pall for this publicity from the newspaper owner,
who sells you three yards of his printed fabric, than to
demand from the linen-draper from what wholesale house
he got his calico ; who spun it ; who owned the cotton ; and
who cropped it in America. It is the article, and not the
name and pedigree of the artificer, which a newspaper or
any other dealer has a right to sell to the public. If I get
a letter (which Heaven forbid ! ) from Mr. Tapes my attor-



ON THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC. 193

ney, I know it is not in Tapes's own handwriting ; J know it
is a clerk writes it ; — so, a newspaper is a composite work
got up by many hireling hands, of whom it is necessary to
know no other name than the printer's or proprietor's.

It is not to be denied that men of signal ability will
write for years in papers and perish unknown — and in so
far their lot is a hard one ; and the chances of life are
against them. It is hard upon a man, with whose work the
whole town is ringing, that not a soul should know or care
who is the author that so delights the public.

But, on the other hand, if your article is excellent, would
you have had any great renown from it, supposing the
paper had not published it? Would you have had a
chance at all but for that paper? Suppose you had
brought out that article upon a broadsheet, who would
have bought it ? Did you ever hear of an unknown man
making a fortune by a pamphlet ?

Again, it may so happen to a literary man that the
stipend which he receives from one publication is not suffi-
cient to boil his family pot, and that he must write in some
other quarter. If Brown writes articles in the daily
papers, and articles in the weekly and monthly periodicals,
too, and signs the same, he surely weakens his force by ex-
tending his line. It would be better for him to write incog-
nito, than to placard his name in so many quarters — as
actors understand, who do not perform in too many pieces
on the same night ; and painters, who know that it is not
worth their while to exhibit more than a certain number of
pictures.

Besides, if to some men the want of publicity is an evil :
to many others the privacy is most welcome. Many a
young barrister is a public writer, for instance, to whose
future prospects his fame as a literary man would give no
possible aid, and whose intention it is to put away the pen
when the attorneys begin to find out his juridical merits.
To such a man it would only be a misfortune to be known
as a writer of leading articles. His battle for fame and for-
tune is to be made with other weapons than the pen. Then
again, a man without ambition, — and there are very many
such sensible persons, — or whose ambition does not go be-
yond his pot au feu, is happy to have the opportunity of
quietly and honorably adding to his income : of occupying
himself : of improving himself : of paying for Tom at col-
lege, or for Mamma's carriage — and what not. Take

away this modest mask — force every man upon the public
stage to appear with his name placarded, and we lose some
of the best books, some of the best articles, some of the
pleasantest wit that we have ever had.

On the whole, then, in this controversy I am against
Hitchings ; and although he insists upon it that he is a per-
secuted being, I do not believe it ; and although he declares
that I ought to consider myself trampled on by the world,
I decline to admit that I am persecuted, and protest that it
treats me and my brethren kindly in the main.

MR. SPEC'S EEMONSTRANCE.

1843.

From the Door Steps.

SIR, — Until my Cartoons are exhibited, I am in an
exceedingly uncomfortable state. I shall then have
about fourteen hundred pounds (the amount of the seven
first prizes), and but a poor reward for the pains and care
which I have bestowed on my pieces.

Meanwhile how am T to exist ? — how, I say, is an his-
torical painter to live ? I despise humor and buffoonery
as unworthy the aim of a great artist. But I am hungry,
Sir, — HUNGRY ! Since Thursday, the 13th instant, butch-
er's meat has not passed these lips, and then 'twas but the
flap of a shoulder of mutton, which I ate cold — cold, and
without pickles, — icy cold, for 'twas grudged by the nig-
gard boor at whose table I condescended to sit down.

That man was my own cousin — Samuel Spec, the emi-
nent publisher of Ivy Lane ; and by him and by all the
world I have been treated with unheard-of contumely. List
but to a single instance of his ingratitude !

I need not ask if you know my work, " Illustrations of
Aldgate Pump." All the world knows it. It is published
in elephant folio, price seventy guineas, by Samuel Spec
before mentioned ; and many thousands of copies were sub-
scribed for by the British and Foreign nobility.

Nobility ! — why do I say nobility ? — Kings, Sir, have
set their august signatures to the subscription list. Ba-

varia's Sovereign has placed it in the Pinakothek. The
Grecian Otho (though I am bound to say he did not pay up)
has hung it in the Parthenon — in the Parthenon ! It may
be seen on the walls of the Vatican, in the worthy company
of Buonarroti and Urbino, and figures in the gilded saloons
of the Tuileries, the delight of Delaroche and Delacroix.

From all these potentates, save the last, little has been
received in return for their presentation-copies but unsub-
stantial praise. It is true the King of Bavaria wrote a
sonnet in acknowledgment of the " Illustrations " ; but I do
not understand German, Sir, and am given to understand
by those who do, that the composition is but a poor one.
His Holiness the Pope gave his blessing, and admitted the
publisher to the honor of kissing his great toe. But I had
rather have a beefsteak to my lips, any day of the week ;
and " Fine words," as the poet says, " butter no parsnips."
Parsnips ! — I have not even parsnips to butter.

His Majesty Louis-Philippe, however, formed a noble ex-
ception to this rule of kingly indifference. Lord Cowley,
our Ambassador, presented my cousin Spec to him with a
copy of my work. The Royal Frenchman received Samuel
Spec with open arms in the midst of his Court, and next
day, through our Ambassador, offered the author of the
" Illustrations " the choice of the Grand Cross of the Legion
of Honor or a snuff-box set with diamonds. I need not say
the latter was preferred.

Nor did the monarch's gracious bounty end here. Going
to his writing-table, he handed over to the officier d^ordon-
nance who was to take the snuff-box, a purely artistic me-
mento of his royal good-will. "Go, Count," said he, "to
Mr. Spec, in my name, offer him the snuff-box — 'tis of tri-
fling value ; and at the same time beg him to accept, as a
testimony of the respect of one artist for another, my own
identical piece of india-rubber."

When Sam came back, I hastened to his house in Ivy
Lane. I found him, Sir, as I have said — I found him eat-
ing cold mutton ; and so I requested him (for my neces-
sities were pressing) to hand me over the diamond box, and
returning to my humble home greedily opened the packet
he had given me.

Sir, he kept the box and gave me the India rubber ! 'Tis
no falsehood — I have left it at your office, where all the
world may see it. I have left it at your office, and with it
this letter. I hear the sound of revelry from within — the

A TURKISH LETTER CONCERNING /HE DI-
VERTISSEMENT "LES HOURIS."

(translated by our own dragoman.)

1843.

Hadji Heer to Hadji Thair.

London, A, H., 1222.

HADJI THAIR, thou friend of my youth ! Long had
I been in this miserable city of the Giaours, before
I could discover that there was any place to which the faith-
ful could resort to the comfort of their souls and the praise
of the great Prophet. Yea, the sound of the mufti's voice
was not heard from the minaret, the cupola of the mosque
did not present itself to the thirsting eye of the Mussul-
man, and at the corner of every street were vast palaces
called the palaces of Djin, where the forbidden liquor, and
other liquors even more abominable, were sold to the in-
fidels. The atmosphere of the whole city was a stench in
the nostrils of the faithful, and my soul was cast down.

But Allah is great, and Mahomet is his prophet. I have
found refreshment for my soul ; I have discovered the green
place in the desert, where the faithful may water the camels
of their hearts and eat the dates of consolation. For after
sunset yesterday I was taken to a splendid palace, called
the Hop-Rah, and there did I see the doctrines of the
Prophet set forth in a most sublime fashion. Yea, the
truth of the Koran was realized ; and would that the vener-
able Imaum Bigh-Phul, who instructed both thee and me,
friend of my youth, in our infancy, had been present ! He
^vould have stroked his white beard with delight, and privily
have murmured Allah Bismilla.

This Hop-Rah belongs to the powerful Ameer, whom they
Call Ben Lomli, and who endeavoreth to instill into the
hearts of the perverse Giaours a few drops of the only
timie doctrine. Oh, a faithful Mussulman must he be, for it
is said that once, when he was told the Hop-Rah was full

ot guests, he exclaimed, " Then great is the Prophet ! "
By a living picture has he shown the blessed effects of
abstaining from the forbidden liquor, and woe be to the
Giaours if their hearts now remain unchanged. For he
hath set forth the delights of Paradise, and the fascination
of the Houris, an.d how they were awarded to a youth who
spumed the intoxicating drink. He hath represented Parar
dise full of clouds, which shine brightly, as the smoke from
the pipe of the Commander of the Faithful And the prin-
cipal Houri is called Doom-y-lateer, whose eyes shine like
the tiger's, whose skin is fair as the snow of Caucasus, tinged
with the roses of the setting sun, and whose face is like the
brightness of the moon.




This fail Hotiri floats among the elouds, spreading delight
around her; and even the Giaours, who frequent the palace,
do exclaim with delight when they see how she droppeth
into the arms of the faithful youth. And there are many
other Houris who inhabit the happy realm, and of these
the leaders be called Ka-Meel, Shay -Per, and Plan-Kai.
And in Paradise do these eternal maidens disport them-
selves, and await the coming of true believers, whom they
will crown with celestial joy. Priend of my youth, I stiU
think on the young Ka-Meel, whose feet are as those of
the antelope, when he prancea to the music that the bul-
bul uttereth when he singeth to the rose. The picture, as
I am told, is the work of a holy man, a spinning Dervish,

named Pey-Eoh. Oh, Hadji Thair, remember the Koran,
and the precepts of Bigh-Phul, the preceptor of our in*
fancy ; and in future times, when the Giaours shall have
fallen from the narrow bridge into the endless abyss, we
shall live with the lovely Houris, Doom-y-lateer, KarMeel,
Shay-Fer, and Plan-Kai.

Ever thine,

Hadji Heer.

London, A, H., 1222.

Friend of my soul, the first letter, wherein I poured
out to thee the raptures of my heart, was translated into
the English tongue by the Dragoman of one Punch, a holy
man of small stature, who teacheth the people wisdom from
a pulpit, which his Imaums erect in the comers of the
streets, and who every week setteth forth on a scroll, in a
pleasant style, such truths as the unenlightened Giaours
are able to bear. The translation he hath inserted in his
scroll, so that if any accident should prevent the letter
reaching thee, thou wilt find it in the scroll, which is read
in all parts of the world, particularly at our beloved Con-
stantinople.

At first I was sorry to find that the infidels, when they
read the translation of my letter, put on it so perverse a
meaning, that they thought the Imaum Bigh-Phul merely
signified " big fool," which signifieth, in their language,
one whose brain Allah hath not enlightened. The night-
traveller doth not shrink with more horror from the raven-
ous Goule, than I shrink from this profane interpretation ;
but a second visit to the Hop-Eah hath convinced me, that
the Giaours were not so far wrong, and that the Imaum is
not such a light of the faithful as we have considered, but
hath grievously misled both thee and me, friend of my
youth ! For the Imaum Bigh-Phul instructed us that the
Paradise of the Faithful was perfect, and was no more
susceptible of improvement than the sword of the Prophet.
But this is false, Hadji ; for the Paradise which I saw on
my second visit to the Hop-Eah surpassed that which I be-
fore told thee of, as the song of Hafiz surpasseth that of
Yezid, the son of Moawiyah. The Houri Doom-y-lateer
hath left Paradise, and the Imaum Lomli hath put in her
stead another Houri, whom they call Chai-ree-toh. Hadji,
to this Houri are all other Houris but vanity and delusion ;
not Zuleika, who tried to lure the young Yusuf from the
paths of wisdom, of which Hafiz hath so often sung, may
be compared to the new Houri. She doth not look like a

passing cloud, lightly floating before the west wind, as did
the Houri Doom-y-lateer ; she doth not appear as one of the
dreams, with which Eblis often tantalizeth even the Faith-
ful; but she is a reality of perfection. The first tint of
the morning sun doth not beam more softly on the moun-
tain-tops than do the eyes of Chai-ree-toh on the faithful
youth who supporteth her, and the eagle doth not dart more
swiftly on his prey than doth the new Houri amid the
clouds of Paradise. Yea, Hadji, the new Houri not only
danceth, but, by the beard of my father, she can fly, and
without wings. Mighty is the power of Chai-ree-toh ! The
rush of the torrent is strong when it sweepeth down the
trees and the hut of the shepherd ; the bound of the young
lion is strong when he seizeth on the traveller; but, oh,
their might is as nothing to the might of Chai-ree-toh ! Yet
doth not fierceness dwell within her heart, for she useth her
might as it were a pleasant sport, and boundeth along, laugh-
ing lightly, and rejoicing in her own wonder. And when
she resteth she smileth on the guests, and their hearts beat
lightly within their bosoms, for the soft breath of the west
wind doth not diffuse such joy as the smile of Chai-ree-toh.
Friend of my youth, tell the Imaum Bigh-Phul how well
I employ my time while in this infidel town, and pray
enlighten him in the point of doctrine to which I have al-
luded, that he may not mislead the sons of Islam. And
show him the enclosed Ghazul, which I have writ in the
Persian tongue.

SINGULAE LETTEE FEOM THE EEGENT OF

SPAIN.

1843.

WE have received by our usual express, the following
indignant protest signed by his Highness the
Regent of Spain.

His Highness's Bando refers to the following paragraph,
which appears in the Times of December 7th : —

" The A^nts of the Tract Societies have latehr had lecourse to a new
method of introducing their tracts into CSadiz. The tracts were put into
(rlass bottles, securely corked ; and taking advantage of the tide flowing
into the harbor, they were committed to the waves, on whose surface they
floated towards the town, where the inhabitants eagerly took them up on
their arriving on the shore. The bottles were then uncorked, and the
tracts they contain are supposed to have been read with much interest."

BANDO, BY THE REGENT OF SPAIN.

The undersigned Eegent of Spain, Duke of Victory, and
of the Regent's Park, presents his compliments to your Ex-
cellency, and requests your excellent attention to the above
extraordinary paragraph.

Though an exile from Spain, the undersigned still feels
an interest in everything Spanish, and asks Punch, Lord
Aberdeen, and the British nation whether friends and allies
are to be insulted by such cruel stratagems ? If the arts of
the Jesuit have justly subjected him to the mistrust and
abhorrence of Europe, ought not the manoeuvres of the Dis-
senting-Tract Smuggler (Tractistero dissentero contrabandis-
tero) to be likewise held up to public odium ?

Let Punch, the Lord Aberdeen, let Great Britain at large,
put itself in the position of the poor mariner of Cadiz, and
then answer. Tired with the day's labor, thirsty as the
seaman naturally is, he lies perchance, and watches at eve
the tide of ocean swelling into the bay. What does he see
cresting the wave that rolls toward him ? A bottle. Re-
gardless of the wet, he rushes eagerly towards the advanc-
ing flask.

Common," or " The Little Blind Dustman of Pentonvllle."
Moral and excellent those works may be, but not at sv.ch
a moment. No ! His Highness the Duke of Victory pro-
tests, in the face of Europe, against this audacious violation
of the right of nations. He declares himself dissentient
from the Dissenters ; he holds up these black-bottle Trac-
tariaas to the contumely of insulted mankind.




"tracts, by jingo."

And against the employment of bottles in this unnatural
fashion he enters a solemn and hearty protest ; lest British
captains might be induced to presume still farther ; lest,
having tampered with the bottle department, they might
take similar liberties with the wood, and send off mission-
aries in casks (securely bunged) for the same destination.

The hand of the faithful General Nogueras has executed
the designs which accompany this Bando, so as to render
its contents more intelligible to the British public ; and, iu
conclusion, his Highness the Regent presents to your Excel-
lency (and the Lady Judy) the assurances of his most dis-
tinguished consideration. May you both live nine hundred
and ninety-nine years.

But yet I think I had an English heart.

When all the Kings were prostrate, I alone

Nor ever could the ruthless Frenchman forge
A fetter for Old England and Old George :

I let loose flaming Nelson on his fleets ;
I met his troops with Wellesley's bayonets.

Triumphant waved my flag on land and sea :
Where was the King in Europe like to me ?

Monarchs exiled found shelter on my shores ;
My bounty rescued Kings and Emperors.

But what boots victory by land or sea ?

What boots that Kings found refuge at my knee ?

I was a conqueror, but yet not proud ;
And careless, even though Napoleon bow'd.

The rescued Kings came kiss my garments' hem :
The rescued Kings I never heeded them.

My guns roar'd triumph, but I never heard :
All England thrilled with joy, I never stirred.

What care had I of pomp, or fame, or power —
A crazy old blind man in Windsor Tower ?

HoLBOKN Hill, Settling-day,

Oct, 30, 1845.

Dear Mr. Punch, — As I was going down Stagg Al-
ley yesterday, to sign the Great Di(Uand deed, I saw the
prettiest little Brougham in the world pull up, at Horn
Street — and the sweetest little love of a figure you ever
saw, step out of the vehicle. Her appearance created quite
a sensation among the stagging gents, and caused even me
to pause and look round.

Greatly to my surprise, this lovely young lady tripped
by me, walked into the Didland Office, where up comes all
the clerks crowding and /grinning about her, and signed the
deed with the ^reat^^st coolness in the world. I peeped
over her shoulder, and saw her write —

I have not given her real name here, but if she took no-
tice of a gent, in a green coat and little blue satin stock,
light auburn hair and whiskers, diamond pin and brown

next, she will see one at the Achilles statue whose inten-

TITMARSH V. TAIT.
1846.

MY DEAE MR. PUNCH, — You are ax^knowledged
to be the censor of the age, and the father and pro-
tector of the press ; in which character allow one of your
warmest admirers to appeal to you for redress and protec-
tion. One of those good-natured friends, of whom every
literary man can boast, has been criticising a late work of
mine in Taifs Magazine. What his opinion may be is
neither here nor there. Every man has a right to his own :
and whether the critic complains of want of purpose, or
says (with great acuteness and ingenuity) that the book
might have been much better, is not at all to the point.
Against criticism of this nature no writer can cavil. It is
cheerfully accepted by your subscriber.

But there is a passage in the Tait criticism which, al-
though it may be actuated by the profoundest benevolence,
a gentleman may be pardoned for protesting against politely.
It is as follows : —

'' Id the circumstance of a steamer being launched on a first voyage to
Margate, or were it but to Greenwich, there is always an invited party, a
band of music, a couple of Times and Chronicle reporters, also champagne
and bottled porter, with cakes and jellies for the ladies. Even on the Frith
of Forth, or Clyde " [this *' even " is very naive and fine], " or the rivers
Severn or Shannon, the same auspicious event is celebrated by the pres-
ence of a piper or blind fiddler, carried cost free, and permitted, on com-
ing home, to send round his hat. On something like the same principle,
the Peninsular and Oriental Company were so fortunate as to crimp Mr.
Titmarsh. . . . We hope they have voted him a yachting service of plate,
of at least five hundred ounces.''

This latter suggestion I complain of, as being too friendly.
Why should the critic insist on a collection ? Who asked
the gentleman for plack or bawbee ? However, this again
is a private matter.

It is that comparison of the blind fiddler who ^^ sends
round his hat,^^ that ought to be devoted to the indignation
of the press of these kingdoms. Your constant reader has
never played on the English — or on the Scotch fiddle.



TITMARSH V. TAIT. 215

He leaves the sending round of hats to professors of the
Caledonian Cremona. He was not " crimped " by the Pen-
insular and Oriental Company, nor called upon to fiddle for
their amusement, nor rewarded with silver spoons by that
excellent Company. A gentleman who takes a vacant seat
in a friend's carriage is not supposed to receive a degrading
obligation, or called upon to pay for his ride by extra jok-
ing, facetiousness, etc.; nor surely is the person who so
gives you the use of his carriage required to present you
also with a guinea, or to pay your tavern-bill. The critic,
in fact, has shown uncommon keenness in observing the
manners of his national violinists ; but must know more of
them than of the customs of English gentlemen.

If the critic himself is a man of letters, and fiddles pro-
fessionally, why should he abuse his Stradivarius ? If he
is some disguised nobleman of lofty birth, superb breeding,
and vast wealth, who only fiddles for pleasure, he should
spare those gentlefolks in whose company he condescends
to perform. But I don't believe he's a noble amateur ; —
I think he must be a professional man of letters. It is
only literary men, nowadays, who commit this suicidal sort
of impertinence ; who sneak through the world ashamed of
their calling, and show their independence by befouling the
trade by which they live.

That you will rebuke, amend, or (if need be) utterly
smash all such, is, my dear Mr. Punch, the humble
prayer of

Your constant reader and fellow-laborer,

Michael Angelo Titmarsh.

A PLEA FOR PLUSH.




Bbi-oravla, Jvly 1, 1S46.
DEAR SIR, — Having

observed on aever^



warda the Jeameses

, of the metropolis, I
desire to call the at-
tention of the public,
through your means,
to an instance of ex-
cessive cruelty which
is daily practised by
a heartless Duchess,
who resides in this
parish, towards sev-
eral of the iinest specimens of humanity which it has ever
been my good fortune to behold.

You must recollect, Mr. Punch, the state of the thermom-
eter during the past month — generdly between eighty
and ninety degrees in the shade. Well, Sir, during the
whole of that fiery season, the merciless woman whom I am
anxious to expose kept four of her fellow-creatures daily
encased in close-fitting garments of scarlet plush I ! ! They
wear them Still.

It makes my heart bleed to witness the protracted suf-
ferings of these large plethoric men ; one of them a Hall
Porter, of mature ^e and startling obesity. There they
stand, on the steps before the street-door, making passers-
by winlt and nursery-maids blush at the splendor of their
attire — white, scarlet, and gold — perspiring exceedingly,
and irritated to madness by the blue-bottle flies and impu-
dent little boys of the vicinity, who unceasingly exclaim,
with exasperating monotony, "I say. Blazes, vy don't you
buy a Wenham 'frigerator ? "



A PLEA FOR PLUSH. 221

I have ascertained with grief, Mr. Punch, that these un-
fortunate men have little or no hard work to do, that all
their messages are performed by deputy; they get their
five meals a day — with beer — regular, besides snacks, and
I feel convinced, that if the hot weather lasts, unless they
are indulged with some light genteel occupation, and the
nankeen shorts (which have latterly been introduced with
great success by several benevolent ladies of rank in the
neighborhood), the wretched creatures will inevitably be
struck down by apoplexy on the hall-steps on which they
are so barbarously exposed every day from two till seven.

I have the honor to remain. Sir,

Your obedient Servant,

[We readily give admission to our correspondent's benevolent remon-
strance in behalf of the injured Flush family. But if he had seen, as we
did, at the Duchess of Douche's dijeuner (where the rain came down in
torrents, and the breakfast was served under a macintosh marquee), the
dripping condition of several of the nobility's footmen who sported the
new summer nankeen lower uniform, ^i\wp\vvicf\s would acknowledge,
that in our variable climate plush is, after all, a better stuflF than nankeen
for the breeches of a British footman. — Editor.]

of your mislany injuice me to edress you — I mean those
in which you indulch in mean snears at the conduck of the
Donns of Cambritch Unavussaty.

"Being ony an individgl, and not a Unavussaty mann, it
ill becomes me, I know, to put in my or in the dispute
about the Cambridg Chanslor. My vote (did I pesess that

instantly reckonised his elygnt urbannaty, ^his retiring
modesty, his unfained umillaty, and his genuin cuttisy,' —
jest as ^Anti-Junius,' in the Times igspresses 'em — and
I've no doubt his pupils was ^his absobbing care.' I've
heerd say, by gents who were at Cambridg College, that
his love for the young fellers was ackshly affecting to
see ; that one of 'em was never ill, but he sor him take his
medsan and put his feet in hot water ; that he wrote to the
Mars of every 1 of them every mawning ; that he used to
waep when they went ome for the oladays ; that he ruined
himself in making 'em presents, and giving 'em parties ; in
a wud, there was no end to his kindness and femilliar re-
gard for 'em.

" If he doesn't allow young gentlemen to sit down in his
presents now ; you must remember Mr. Punch, that the
purshoots of these Schudents is already sednterry : and it's
unwholesome for 'em to be too long in a sittn postar.

" This however is not the point which I wish to present

tion of indipendns which has caused Masters of Arts &

there 's no truckling about us — we never kiss a great man's
shoo-strings ; and if the Unavussaty chooses a Young
Jumman Prince of sixntwenty for its Chanslor depend on
it it ad its reasns. Depend on it he'll be an honor to his
Halmymater. He was chose not on account of his exalted
rank but on account of his ' admirable virtues ' — it was
them that made him Chanslor, and no mistake.

"Y — you've only to read his Koil Highness own roil

ous and influential a portion of the Senate of the U. of C,
including so many eminent names, that I should allow my-
self to be proposed for election into the vacant oflB.ce of the
C. of the U., cannot be otherwise than highly gratifying to
my feelings. Did it not appear from proceedings entered
into by others in the University that there does not exist
that unanimity which alone would leave me at liberty to
consent to be put in nomination, I should have felt both
the greatest pleasure and pride in acceding to the desire
expressed in this address, and so personally connecting my- .
self with your ancient and renowned seat of learning.'

Chanslor, that it's impawsable to think of any other, —
to ignoUedge that His E. H. is the man, as you ignol-

they took his Roil Highnes nolus bolus (to use a Lating

THE WESTMINSTER HALL EXHIBITION.



PROFESSOR BYLES'S OPIKION OF THE WEST-
MINSTER HALL EXHIBITION.



Sib,—



1847.




Y three pictures, from " Gil
Bias," from the "Vicar of

Wakefield," and from Eng-
lish History (King John sign-
ing that palladium of our
liberties. Magna Charta), not
having been sent to West-
-MMf ._ __ — —— ~^ -^ minster, in consequence of
the dastardly refusal of Blad-
ders, my colour merchant, to supply me with more paint —
I have lost 1,500Z. as a painter, but gained a right to speak
as a critic of the Exhibition. A more indifferent collection
of works it has seldom been my lot to see.

1 do not quarrel much with the decision of the Com-
mittee : indifferent judges called upon to decide as to the
merits of indifferent pictures, they have performed their
office fairly. I congratulate the three prize-holders on their
success. I congratulate them that three pictures, which
shall be nameless, were kept, by conspiracy, from the Ex-
hibition.

Mr. Piekersgill is marked first ; and I have nothing to
say, — his picture is very respectable, very nicely painted,
and so forth. It represents the burial of King Harold —
there are monks, men-at-arms, a livid body, a lady kissing
it, and that sort of thing. Nothing can be more obvious ;
nor is the picture without merit. And I congratulate the
public that King Harold is buried at last; and hope that
British artists will leave off finding his body any more,
which they have been doing, in every Exhibition, for these
fif^ years.

By the way, as the Saxon king is here represented in the
blue stage of decomposition, I think Mr. P. mi^ht as well
step up to my studio, and look at a certain Iceman chief in



226 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

my great piece of " Boadicea," who is tattooed all over an
elegaoit light blue, and won't lose by comparison with the
" Norman Victim."

Mr. Watts, too, appears to have a hankering for the
Anglo-Saxons. I must say I was very much surprised to
find that this figure was supposed to represent King Alfred
standing on a plank, and inciting his subjects to go to sea
and meet the Danes, whose fleet you will perceive in the
distant ocean — or ultra^marine, as 1 call it. This is another
of your five-hundred-pounders ; and I must say that this




King of the Angles has had a narrow escape that the
"Queen of the Iceni" was not present.

They talk about air in pictures ; there is, I must say,
more wind in this than in any work of art I ever beheld.
It is blowing everywhere and from every quarter. It is
blowing the sail one way, the royal petticoat another, the



THE WESTMINSTER HALL EXHIBITION, 227

cloak another, and it is almost blowing the royal hair off
his Majesty's head. No wonder the poor English wanted a
deal of encouraging before they could be brought to face
such a tempest as that.

By the way, there is an anecdote which I met with in a
scarce work regarding this monarch, and which might afford
an advantageous theme for a painter's skill. It is this : —
Flying from his enemies, those very Danes, the king sought
refuge in the house of a neatherd, whose wife set the royal
fugitive a-toasting muffins. But, being occupied with his
misfortunes, he permitted the muffins to burn ; whereupon,
it is said, his hostess actually boxed the royal ears. I have
commenced a picture on this subject, and beg artists to
leave it to the discoverer. The reader may fancy the muffins
boldly grouped and in flames, the incensed harridan, the
rude hut, — and the disguised monarch. With these ma-
terials I hope to effect a great, lofty, national, and original
work, when my "Boadicea" is off the easel.

With respect to the third prize — a " Battle of Meeanee "

— in this extraordinary piece they are stabbing, kicking,
cutting, slashing, and poking each other about all over the
picture. A horrid sight ! I like to see the British lion
mild and good-humored, as Signor Gambardella has de-
picted him ('my initial is copied from that artist) ; not fierce,
as Mr. Armitage has shown him.

How, I ask, is any delicate" female to look without a
shudder upon such a piece ? A large British soldier, with
a horrid bayonet poking into a howling Scindian. Is the
monster putting the horrid weapon into the poor benighted
heathen's chest, or is the ruffian pulling the weapon out, or
wriggling it round and round to hurt his victim so much
the more ? Horrid, horrid ! " He^s giving him his grueip
I heard some fiend remark, little knowing by whom he
stood. To give 500Z. for a work so immoral, and so odious
a picture, is encouraging murder, and the worst of murders

— that of a black man. If the Government grants pre-
miums for massacre, of course I can have no objection ; but
if Mr. Armitage will walk to my studio, and look at my
" Battle of Bosworth Field," he will see how the subject
may be treated, without hurting the feelings, with a combi-
nation of the beautiful and the ideal — not like Mr. Coo-
per's "Waterloo," where the French cuirassiers are riding
about, run through the body, or with their heads cut off,
and smiling as if they liked it ; but with the severe moral
grandeur that befits the " Historic Muse."



228 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS,

So much for the three first prizes. I congratulate the
winners of the secondary prizes (and very secondary their
talents are indeed), that some of my smaller pictures were
not sent in, owing to my mind being absorbed with greater
efforts. What does Mr. Cope mean by his picture of
" Prince Henry trying his Father^s Crown " ? The subject
is mine, discovered by me in my studies in recondite works ;
and any man who borrows it is therefore guilty of a plagia-
rism. " Bertrand de Gourdon pardoned by Richard " is a
work of some merit — but why kings, Mr. Cross ? Why
kings, Messieurs artists ? Have men no hearts save under
the purple ? Does sorrow only sit upon thrones ? For in-
stance, we have Queen Emma walking over hot plough-
shares in her night-clothes — her pocket-handkerchief
round her eyes. Have no other women burnt their limbs
or their fingers with shares ? My aunt, Mrs. Growley, I
know, did two years ago. But she was a mere English
lady; it is only kings and queens that our courtiers of
painters condescend to feel for.

Their slavishness is quite sickening. There is the " Birth
of the First Prince of Wales " (my subject, again) ; there
is the "White Ship going down with King Henry's Son
aboard;'' there is "King Henry being informed of the
Death of his Son by a little Boy ; " " King Charles (that
odious profligate) up in the Oak" (again my subject).
Somebody will be painting " Queen Boadicea " next, and
saying I did not invent that.

Then there are Allegories. — Oh ! allegories, of course !
Every painter must do his " Genius of Britannia," forsooth,
after mine ; and subjects in all costumes, from the Ancient
Britons in trews (whom Mr. Moore has represented as
talking to Sir Robert Peel's friend, and the founder of the
Trent Valley Railroad, Mr. Julius Agricola) down to the
Duke of Marlborough in jack-boots, and his present Grace
in those of his own invention. So there are some pictures
in which, I regret to say, there is very little costume in-
deed.

There are " Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise," with
the birds of Paradise flying out too. There are " Peace,
Commerce, and Agriculture," none of them with any
clothes to their backs. There is " Shakspeare being edu-
cated by Water Nymphs " (which I never knew kept a
school), with a Dolphin coming up to give him a lesson —
out of the " Delphin Classics," I suppose. Did the painter



THE WESTMINSTER HALL EXHIBITION, 229

ever see my sketch of " Shakspeare " ? Is the gentleman
who has stripped " Commerce " and " Agriculture " of their
gowns aware that I treated a similar allegory in, I flatter
myself, a different style ? I invite them all to my studio
to see: North Paradise Eow, Upper Anna Maria Street,
Somers Town East. And wishing, Mr. Punch, that you
would exchange your ribaldry for the seriousness befitting
men of honesty,

I remain, your obedient Servant,

Growley Byles.

HE had appointed me in St. James's Park, under the
Duke of York's Column, on Guy Fawkes' day ; and
I found the venerable man at the hour and at the place
assigned looking exceedingly sweet upon the gambols of
some children : who were accompanied, by the .way, by a
very comely young woman as a nursery-maid. He left the
little ones with a glance of kindness, and, hooking his little
arm into mine, my excellent and revered friend Mr. Punch
and I paced the Mall for a while together.

I had matters of deep importance (in my mind, at least)
to communicate to my revered patron and benefactor. The
fact is, I have travelled as Mr. Punch's Commissioner in
various countries ; and having, like all persons of inquiring
mind, from Ulysses downwards, a perpetual desire for loco-
motion, I went to propose to our beloved chief a new tour.
I set before him eloquently the advantages of a trip to
China, or, now that the fighting was over, a journey to
Mexico I thought might be agreeable — or why not travel
in the United States, I asked, where Punch's Commissioner
would be sure of a welcome, and where the natives have
such a taste for humorous description ?

" My dear Spec," said the sage, in reply to a long speech
of mine, "you are, judging from your appearance, five-and
twenty years old, and consequently arrived at the estate of
man. You have written for my publication a number of
articles, which, good, bad, and indifferent as they are, make
me suppose that you have some knowledge of the world.
Have you lived so long in this our country as not to know
that Britons do not care a fig for foreign affairs ? Who
takes any heed of the Spanish marriages now ? — of the
Mexican wars ? — of the row in Switzerland ? Do you
know whether a Vorort is a gentleman, or a legislative
body, or a village in the Canton of Uri ? Do you know a
man who reads the Spanish and Portuguese correspondence



TRAVELS IN LONDON. 281

in the newspapers ? Sir, I grow sick at the sight of the
name of Bomfin, and shudder at the idea of Costa Cabral ! "
and he yawned so portentously as he spoke, that I saw all
my hopes of a tour were over. Recovered from that spasm,
the Good and Wise One continued, — " You are fond of
dabbling in the fine arts, Mr. Spec — now pray, sir, tell me,
which department of the Exhibition is most popular ? "

I unhesitatingly admitted that it was the portraits the
British public most liked to witness. Even when I exhib-
ited my great picture of Heliogabalus, I owned that no-
body —

" Exactly — that nobody looked at it ; whereas everyone
examines the portraits with interest, and you hear people
exclaim, ^ Law, Ma ! if it ain't a portrait of Mrs. Jones, in
a white satin and a tiara ; ' or, * Mercy me ! here's Alderman
Blogg in a thunderstorm,' etc. etc. - The British public like
to see representations of what they have seen before. Do
you mark me. Spec ? In print, as in art, sir, they like to
recognize Alderman Blogg." He paused, for we had by
this time mounted the Duke of York's Steps, and, panting
a little, pointed to the noble vista before us with his cane.
We could see the street thronged with life ; the little chil-
dren gathered round the column ; the omnibuses whirling
past the Drummond light; the carriages and flunkeys
gathered round Howell and James's ; the image of Britan-
nia presiding over the County Fire Office in the Quadrant,
and indeed over the scene in general.

" You want to travel ? " said he, whisking his bamboo.
"Go and travel there, sir. Begin your journey this mo-
ment. I give you my commission. Travel in London, and
bring me an account of your tour. Describe me yonder
beggar's impudence, sir ; or yonder footman's calves ; or my
Lord Bishop's cob and apron (my Lord Bishop, how do you
do ?). Describe anything — anybody. Consider your jour-
ney is begun foom this moment ; and left foot forward —
March ! " So speaking, my benefactor gave me a playful
push in the back, in the direction of Waterloo Place, and
turned into the Athenaeum, in company with my Lord
Bishop of Bullocksmithy, whose cob had lust pulled up at
the door, and I walked away alone into the immenKity of
London, which my Great blaster had bid me to explore*

I staggered before the vastness of that j>rospect. Xot
naturally a modest man, yet I asked myself mentally, how
am I to grapple with a subject so tremendous ? Every

man and woman I met was invested with an awful charac-
ter, and to be examined as a riddle to be read henceforth.
The street-sweeper at the crossing gave me a leer and a
wink and a patronizing request for a little trifle, which
made me turn away from him and push rapidly forward.
" How do I know, my boy," thought T, inwardly, " but that
in the course of my travels I may be called upon to ex-
amine you — to follow you home to your lodgings and back
into your early years — to turn your existence inside out,
and explain the mystery of your life ? How am I to get
the clue to that secret ? " He luckily spun away towards
Waterloo Place with a rapid flourish of his broom, to accost
the Honorable Member" for Muffborough, just arrived in
town, and who gave the sweeper a gratuity of twopence ;
and I passed over the crossing to the United Service Club
side. Admiral Boarder and Colonel Charger were seated in
the second window from the corner, reading the paper —
the Admiral, bald-headed and jolly-faced, reading with his
spectacles — the Colonel, in a rich, curly, dark-purple wig,
holding the Standard as far off as possible from his eyes,
and maiing believe to read without glasses. Other persons
were waiting at the gate. ]Mrs. General Cutandthrust's lit-
tle carriage was at the door, waiting for the General, while
the young ladies were on the back seat of the carriage, en-
tertained by Major Slasher, who had his hand on the but-
ton- I ran away as if guill^'. " Slasher, Boarder, Charger,
Cutandthrust, the young ladies, and their mother with the
chestnut front — there is not one of you," thought I, " but
may come under my hands professionally, and I must show
up all your histories at the stem mandate of Mr. Punch."

I rushed up that long and dreary passage which skirts
the back of the Opera, and where the mysterious barbers
and boot-shops are. The Frenchman who was walking up
and down there, the very dummies in the hairdressers' win-
dows seemed to look at me with a new and dreadful signi-
ficance — a fast-looking little fellow in check trousers and
glossy boots, who was sucking the end of his stick and his
cigar alternately, while bestriding a cigar chest in Mr. Al-
varez's shop — Mr. A. himself, that stately and courteous
merchant who offers you an Havana as if you were a
Grandee of the first class — everybody, I say, struck me
with fright. " Not one of these," says I, " but next week
you may be called upon to copy him down ; " and I did not
even look at the fast young man on the chest, further than

to observe that a small carrot sprouted from his chin, and
that he wore a shirt painted in scarlet arabesques.

I passed down Saint Albans Place, where the noble H. P.
officers have lodgings, without ever peeping into any one of
their parlors, and the Haymarket, brilliant with gin-shops,
brawling with cabmen, and thronged with lobsters. At the
end towards the Quadrant, the poor dirty foreigners were
sauntering about greasily ; the hansoms were rattling ; the
omnibuses cutting in and out ; my Lord Tomnoddy's cab,
with the enormous white horse, was locked in with Doctor
Bullfrog's purple brougham, and a cartful of window-frames
and shop-fronts. Part of the pavement of course was up,
and pitch-caldrons reeking in the midst ; omnibus cads bawl-
ing out " Now then, stoopid ! " over all. " Am I to describe
all these, I thought ; to unravel this writhing perplexity ;
to set sail into this boundless ocean of life ? What does my
Master mean by setting me so cruel a task ; and how the
deuce am I to travel in London ? " I felt dazzled, amazed,
and confounded, like stout Cortes, when with eagle's eyes
he stared at the Pacific in a wild surprise, silent upon a
peak in What-d'ye-call-'em. And I wandered on and on.

" Well met," said a man, accosting me. " What is the
matter, Spec ? Is your banker broke ? "

I looked down. It was little Frank Whitestock, the
Curate of Saint Timothy's, treading gingerly over the
mud.

I explained to Frank my mission and its tremendous na-
ture, my modest fears as to my competency, my perplexity
where to begin.

The little fellow's eyes twinkled roguishly. "Mr. Punch
is right," said he. " If you want to travel, my poor Spec,
you should not be trusted very far beyond Islington. It is
certain that you can describe a tea-kettle better than a
pyramid."

"Tea-kettle ! Tea-kettle yourself," says I. "How to begin
is the question."

" Begin ? " says he ; " begin this instant. Come in here
with me ; " and he pulled at one of four bells at an old-
fashioned door by which we were standing.

1848.

_,_.-—;- HE appearance of a London

-(^ 'J:"'~ -^. Club at a time of great ex-

/-.. citement is well ■worthy

__'^ '■ ^;^j — ' \ tlis remark of a traveller

' ~ in this city. The Megathe-

t rium has been in a mon-

strous state of frenzy dur-
ing the past days. What
a queer book it would be
which should chronicle all
the stories which have been
told, or all the opinions
which have been uttered
there.

As a Revolution brings
out into light of day, and
into the streets of the con-
vulsed capital, swarms of
people who are invisible
but in such times of agita-
tion, and retreat into their
obscurity as soon as the
earthquake is over, so you
may remark in Clubs, that
the stirring of any great news brings forth the most won-
derful and hitherto unheard-of members, of whose faces not
the habitues, not even the hall-porters, have any knowledge.
The excitement over, they vanish, and are seen no more
until the next turmoil calls them forth.

During the past week, our beloved Megatherium has been
as crowded as they say her Majesty's Palace of Pimlieo at




TRAVELS IN LONDON. 235

present is, where distressed foreigners, fugitives, and other
Coburgs are crowded two or three in a room ; and where it
has been reported during the whole of the past week that
Louis Philippe himself, in disguise, was quartered in the
famous garden pavilion, and plates of dinner sent out to
him from her Majesty's table. I had the story from Bowyer
of the Megatherium, who had seen and recognized the ex-
King as he was looking into the palace garden, from a
house in Grosvenor Place opposite. We have had other
wonderful stories too, whereof it is our present purpose to
say a word or two.

The Club, in fact, has been in a state of perfect uproar,
to the disgust of the coffee-room habitues, of the quiet li-
brary arm-chair occupiers, and of the newspaper-room stu-
dents, who could not get their accustomed broad-sheets. Old
Doctor Pokey (who is in the habit of secreting newspapers
about his person and going off to peruse them in recondite
comers of the building) has been wandering about, in vain
endeavoring to seize hold of a few. They say that a Morn-
ing Chronicle was actually pulled from under his arm dur-
ing the last week's excitement. The rush for second edi-
tions and evening papers is terrific. Members pounce on
the newsboys and rob them. Decorum is overcome.

All the decencies of society are forgotten during this ex-
citement. Men speak to each other without being intro-
duced. I saw a man in ill-made trousers and with strong
red whiskers and a strong northern accent go up to Colonel
the Honorable Otto Dillwater of the Guards, and make
some dreadful remark about Louis Feelip, which caused the
Colonel to turn pale with anger. I saw a Bishop, an Under-
Secretary of State and General de Boots listening with the
utmost gravity and eagerness to little Bob Noddy, who pre-
tended to have brought some news from the City, where
they say he is a clerk in a Fire Office.

I saw all sorts of portents and wonders. On the great
Saturday night (the 26th ult.), when the news was rifest,
and messenger after messenger came rushing in with wild
rumors, men were seen up at midnight who were always
known to go to bed at ten. A man dined in the Club who
is married, and who has never been allowed to eat there for
eighteen years. On Sunday, old Mr. Pugh himself, who
moved that the house should be shut, no papers taken in,
and the waiters marched to church under the inspection of
the steward, actually came down and was seen reading the

Observer, so eager was the curiosity which the great events
excited.

In the smoking-room of the establishment, where you or-
dinarily meet a very small and silent party, there was hardly
any seeing for the smoke, any sitting for the crowd, or any
hearing in consequence of the prodigious bawling and dis-
puting. The men uttered the most furious contradictory
statements there. Young Biffin was praying that the ras-
cally mob might be cut down to a man ; while Gullet was
bellowing out that the safety of France required the re-
establishment of the guillotine, and that four heads must be
had, or that the Revolution was not complete.

In the card-room, on the great night in question, there
was only one whist-table, and at that even they were ob-
liged to have a dummy. Captain Trumpington could not be
brought to play that night ; and Pamm himself trumped
his partner's lead, and the best heart ; such was the agita-
tion which the great European events excited. When
Dicky Cuff came in, from his excellency Lord Pilgrim-
stone's evening party, a rush was made upon him for news,
as if he had come from battle. Even the waiters appeared
to be interested, and seemed to try to overhear the conver-
sation.

Every man had his story, and his private information ;
and several of these tales I took down.

" Saturday, five o^ clock, — Jawkins has just come from
the City. The French Rothschild has arrived. He escaped
in a water-butt as far as Amiens, whence he went on in a
coffin. Kfourgon containing two hundred and twenty-two
thousand two hundred sovereigns, and nine and fourpence
in silver, was upset in the Rue Saint-Denis. The coin was
picked up, and the whole sum, with the exception of the
fourpenny-piece, was paid over to the Commissioners at the
Hotel de Ville.

" Some say it was a quarter-franc. It was found sticking,
afterwards, to the sahot of an Auvergnat, and brought in
safety to the Provisional Government.

" Blankley comes in. He made his fortune last year by
the railroads, has realized, and is in a frantic state of terror.
^ The miscreants ! ' he says. * The whole population is in
arms. They are pouring down to the English coast ; the
Sans-culottes will be upon us to-morrow, and we shall have
them upon — upon my estate in Sussex, by Jove ! Cobden



TRAVELS IN LONDON. 237

was in a league with the Revolutionary Government when
he said there would be no war — laying a trap to lull us
into security, and so give free ingress to the infernal
revolutionary villains. There are not a thousand men in
the country to resist them, and we shall all be butchered
before a week is out — butchered, and our property confis-
cated. Cobden ought to be impeached and hanged. Lord
John Russell ought to be impeached and hanged. Hope
Guizot will be guillotined for not having used cannon, and
slaughtered the ruffians before the Revolution came to a
head.* — N. B. Blankley was a Liberal before he made his
money, and had a picture of Tom Paine in his study.

" Towzer arrives. A messenger has just come to the
Foreign Office wounded in three places, and in the disguise
of a fishwoman. Paris is in flames in twenty-four quarters
— the mob and pikemen raging through it. Lamartine
has been beheaded. The forts have declared for the King
and are bombarding the town. All the English have been
massacred.

" Captain Shindy says, ' Nonsense ! no such thing.' A
messenger has come to the French Embassy. The King
and family are at Versailles. The two Chambers have fol-
lowed them thither, and Marshal Bugeaud has rallied a
hundred and twenty thousand men. The Parisians have
three days' warning : and if at the end of that time they do
not yield, seven hundred guns will open on the dogs, and
the whole canaille will be hurled to perdition.

" Pipkinson arrives. The English in Paris are congre-
gated in the Protestant churches ; a guard is placed over
them. It is with the greatest difficulty that the rabble are
prevented from massacring them. Lady Lunchington only
escaped by writing ^ Veuve d'O^Connell ' on her door. It is
perfectly certain that Guizot is killed. Lamartine and the
rest of the Provisional Government have but a few days tc
live : the Communists will destroy them infallibly ; and
universal blood, terror, and anarchy will prevail over
France, over Europe, over the world.

"Bouncer — on the best authority. Thirty thousand
French entered Brussels under Lamoriciere. No harm has
been done to Leopold. The united French and Belgian
army march on the Rhine on Monday. Rhenish Prussia is
declared to form a part of the Republic. A division under
General Bedeau will enter Savoy, and penetrate into Lom-
bardy. The Pope abdicates his temporal authority. The



238 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

Russians will cross the Prussian frontier with four hundred
thousand men.

"Bowyer has just come from Mivart's, and says that
rooms are taken there for the Pope, who has fled from his
dominions, for the Countess of Landsf eld, for the King of
Bavaria, who is sure to follow immediately, and for all the
French Princes, and their suites and families.''

It was in this way that Rumor was chattering last week,
while the great events were pending. But oh, my friends !
wild and strange as these stories were, were they so won-
derful as the truth ? — as an army of a hundred thousand
men subdued by a rising of bare-handed mechanics ; as a
great monarch, a Minister notorious for wisdom, and a great
monarchy blown into annihilation by a blast of national
breath ; as a magnificent dynasty slinking out of existence
in a cab ; as a gallant prince, with an army at his back,
never so much as drawing a sword, but at a summons from
a citizen of the National Guard turning tail and sneaking
away ; as a poet braving the pikes which had scared away
a family of kings and princes, and standing forward, wise,
brave, sensible, and merciful, undismayed on the tottering
pinnacle of popular power ? Was there ever a day since
the beginning of history, where small men were so great, and
great ones so little ? What satirist would ever have dared
to invent such a story as that of the brave and famous race
of Orleans flying, with nobody at their backs ; of wives and
husbands separating, and the deuce take the hindmost ; of
Ulysses shaving his whiskers off, and flinging away even
his wig ? It is the shamefullest chapter in history — a
consummation too base for ridicule.

One can't laugh at anything so miserably mean. All the
Courts in Europe ought to go into mourning, or wear sack-
cloth. The catastrophe is too degrading. It sullies the
cause of all kings, as the misconduct of a regiment does an
army. It tarnishes all crowns. And if it points no other
moral, and indicates no future consequences, why. Progress
is a mere humbug: Railroads lead to nothing, and Signs
point nowhere : and there is no To-morrow for the world.

A EOUNDABOUT HIDE.



OUNG HENGIST

having kindly ofEered
to lend me a pony,
I went out for a ride
with him this morn-
ing ; and being now
mercifully restored
to my armchair at
home, I write down,
with a rapid and
faithful pen, the
events of the day.

Hengist lives in
the Tyburn district,
that great rival, and
netime, aa 'twas
I thought, conqueror
of Belgravia, where
squares, catikedrals,
terraces spring up in a night, as it were : where, as you
wandered yesterday, you saw a green strip of meadow, with
a washerwoman's cottage and a tea^arden ; and to-day you
look up, and lo ! you see a portly row of whity-brown bow-
windowed houses, with plate^lass windows, through the
clear panes of which you may see bald-headed comfortable
old fogies reading the Moi-ning Herald. Butlers loll at the
doors — (by the way, the Tyburnian footmen are by no
means so large or so powdery as the Mayfair and Bel-
gravian gentry) — the road is always freshly laid down
with sharp large flintstoues. Missis's neat little brougham
with two bay horses, and the page by the coachman's side,
is creaking over the flints. The apothecary is driving here
and there in a gig ; the broad flag-stones are dotted about
with a good number of tartan jackets and hats, enclosing

wholesome - looking little children. A brand-new fish,
monger's shop is just open, with great large white-bellied
turbots, looking very cool and helpless on the marble slabs.
A genteel stucco-faced public -house is run up for the ac-
commodation of the grooms, and the domestics, and the
hodmen of the neighborhood ; and a great bar is placed at
the end of the street, beyond which is a chaos of bricks,
wheelbarrows, mounds of chalk, with milky-looking pools
beside them, scaffoldings and brown skeletons of houses,
through which the daylight shines, and you can see patches
of green land beyond, which are to be swallowed up pres-
ently by the great devouring City.

This quarter, my dear friends, is what Baker Street was
in the days of our youth. I make no doubt that some of
the best and stupidest dinners in London are given here-
abouts ; dinners where you meet a Baronet, a Knight, and a
snuffy little old General ; and where the master of the house,
the big bald man, leads Lady Barbara Macraw downstairs,
the Earl of Strathbungo's daughter, and godmother to his
seventh child. A little more furniture would make the
rooms look more comfortable ; but they are very handsome
as it is. The silver dish-covers are splendaceous. I wish
the butler would put a little more wine into the glasses,
and come round rather oftener. You are the only poor
man in the room. Those awful grave fellows give each
other dinners round. Their daughters come solemnly in
the evening. The young fellow of the house has been at
Oxford, and smokes cigars, but not in the house, and dines
a good deal out at his Club.

I don't wonder : I once dined with young Hengist, at his
father's, Major-General Sir Hercules Hengist, K. C. B., and
of all the — But hospitality forbids me to reveal the se-
crets of the mahogany.

Having partaken there of a slight refreshment of a
sponge-cake from a former dessert (and a more pretentious,
stuck-up, tasteless, seedy cake than a sponge-cake I don't
know), and a glass of wine, we mounted our horses and rode
out on a great exploring journey. We had heard of Bethnal
Green and Spitalfields; we wished to see those regions;
and we rode forth then like two cavaliers out of Mr.
James's novels — the one was young, with curly chestnut
ringlets, and a blond moustache just shading his upper lip,
etc. — We rode forth out of Tyburnia and down the long
row of terraces to which two Universities have given their
names.



TRAVELS IN LONDON. 241

At the end of Oxford Terrace, the Edgware Road cuts
rapidly in, and the genteel district is over. It expires at
that barrier of twopenny omnibuses : we are nearly cut in
two by one of those disgusting vehicles, as we pass rapidly
through the odious cordon.

We now behold a dreary district of mud, and houses on
either side, that have a decayed and slatternly look, as if
they had become insolvent, and subsequently taken to
drinking and evil courses in their old age. There is a
comer house not very far from the commencement of the
New Road, which is such a picture of broken-windowed
bankruptcy as is only to be seen when a house is in Chan-
cery or in Ireland. I think the very ghosts must be mil-
dewed that haunt that most desolate spot.

As they rode on, the two cavaliers peeped over the board
of the tea-garden at the Yorkshire Stingo. The pillars of
the damp arbors and the legs of the tables were reflected in
the mud.

In sooth 'tis a dismal quarter. What are those whity-
brown small houses with black gardens fronting, and cards
of lodgings wafered into the rickety bow-windows ? Would
not the very idea that you have to pass over that damp and
reeking strip of ground prevent any man from taking those
hopeless apartments ? Look at the shabby children pad-
dling through the slush : and lo ! the red-haired maid-of-all-
work coming out with yesterday's paper and her mistress's
beer-jug in her hand, through the creaking little garden-
door, on which the name of " Sulsh " is written on a dirty
brass plate.

Who is Sulsh ? Why do I want to know that he lives
there ? Ha ! there is the Lying-in Hospital, which always
looks so comfortable that we feel as if we should like to be
in an interesting — fiddlestick ! Here is Milksop Terrace.
It looks like a dowager. It has seen better days, but it
holds its head up still, and has nothing to do with Mary-
lebone Workhouse, opposite, that looks as cheerful as a
cheese-paring.

We rise in respectability: we come upon tall, brown
houses, and can look up long vistas of brick. Off with your
hat. That is Baker Street ; jolly little Upper Baker Street
stretches away Regent's Park-ward ; we pass by Glum
Street, Great Gaunt Street, Upper Hatchment Street;
Tressel Place, and Pall Street — dark, tragic, and respect-
able abodes of worthy people. Their names should be

printed in a black book, instead of a red book, however. I
think they must have been built by an architect and under-
taker.

How the omnibuses cut through the mud City-wards, and-
the rapid cabs with canvas-backed trunks on the top, rush
towards the Great Western Railway. Yonder it lies, be-
yond the odious line of twopenny 'buses.

See, we are at Park Crescent. Portland Place is like a
Pyramid, and has resisted time. It still looks as if Alder-
men lived there, and very beneficed clergymen came to
them to dine. The footmen are generally fat in Portland
Place, I have remarked ; fat and in red plush breeches —
different from the Belgravian gents : from the Tyburnian.
Every quarter has its own expression of plush, as flowers
bloom differently in different climates.

Chariots with lozenges on the panels, and elderly ladies
inside, are driving through the iron gates to take the cheer-
ful round of Regent's Park. When all Nature smiles and
the skies are intolerably bright and blue, the Regency Park
seems to me to have this advantage, that a cooling and
agreeable mist always lies over it and keeps off the glare.

Do people still continue to go to the Diorama ? It is an
entertainment congenial to the respectability of the neigh-
borhood. I know nothing more charming than to sit in a
black room there, silent and frightened, and with a dim
sense that you are turning round ; and then to see the view
of the Church of Saint Rawhead by moonlight, while a dis-
tant barrel-organ plays the Dead March in " Saul " almost
inaudibly.

Yoicks ! we have passed the long defile of Albany Street ;
we cross the road of Tottenham — on either side of us the
cheerful factories with ready-made tombstones and funereal
urns; or great zinc slipper-baths and chimney-pots that
look like the helmets of the Castle of Otranto. Extremely
small cigar-shops, and dentists ; one or two bug-destroyers,
and coffee-shops that look by no means inviting, are re-
marked by self and Hengist as our rapid steeds gallop
swiftly onwards — onwards to the Square of Euston — on-
wards where the towers of Pancridge rise before us — rap-
idly, rapidly.

Ha ! he is down — is he hurt ? — He is up again — it is a
cab-horse on ahead, not one of ours. It is the wood-pave-
ment. Let us turn aside and avoid the dangerous path.

"PUNCH" AND THE INFLUENZA.

A T the beginning of the week, when the Influenza panic
jr-\ seemed at the highest — when the Prime Minister and
his "household — when the public offices and all the chiefs
and subordinates — when the public schools and all the
masters and little boys — when the very doctors and apothe-
caries of the town were themselves in bed — it was not a
little gratifying to Mr. Puxch to find that his contributors,
though sick, were at their duty; and, though prostrate, were
prostrate still round their post. At the first moment when
Mr. Punch himself could stir after his own attack, he
ruBbed to the couches of his young men; and he found
them in the following positions and circumstances of life.

''PUNCH" AND THE INFLUENZA. 245

Taking out a bank-note of immense value, Mr. Punch
laid it on Mr. Sm-th's pillow, and pushed on to another
of his esteemed correspondents — the celebrated Br-wit, in
a word — who was found as follows : —




Yes, he was in a warm bath, composing those fine senti-
ments which the reader will recognize in his noble and
heart-fitirring articles of this week, and as resigned and
hearty as if he had been Seneca.

He was very ill and seemingly on the point of dissolu-
tion ; but his gayety never deserted him.

" You see I am trying to get the steam up still ! " he ex-
claimed, with a sickly smile, and a look of resignation ao
touching that Mr. Punch, unable to bear the sight, had only
leisure to lay an order for a very large amount of £. s. d.
upon the good-natured martyr's clothes-horse, and to quit
the room.

The last of his Contributors whom Mr. Plnch visited on
that day was the Fat One. " Nothing will ever ail him"
Mr. P. mentally remarked. " He has (according to his own
showing) had the Yellow Fever in Jamaica and New Or-
leans ; the Plague twice, and in the most propitious spots
for that disease ; the Jungle Fever, the Pontine Ague,
etc., etc. i every disease, in fact, in every quarter of this

ence to such a tough old traveller as that ; and we shall
find him more jocose and brilliant than ever."

Mr. PuKCH called at the F. C.'s chambers in Jermyn
Street, and saw — what ?




An immense huddle of cloaks and blankets piled over an
immovable mass. All Mr. P. could see of the Contributor
was a part of his red Turkish cap (or tarboosh) peeping
from under the coverlets. A wheezy groan was the tar-
boosh's reply to Mr. Punch's interrogatories.

" Come, P. C, my boy," said Mr. P. encour^ingly ;
" everybody else is doing his duty. You must be up and
stirring. We want your notes upon Archdeacon Laffan
this week ; and your Latin version of Mr. Chisholm An-
atey's speech."

There was no reply, and Mr. Punch reiterated his re-
mark.

" Archdeael Alstey — aid Pulch — aid everyol bay go to
blazes," moaned out the man under the counterpanes, and
would say no more. He was the only man who failed Punch
in the sad days of the Influenza.

" Wheel of Fortune Otel." I have a clubb of twenty for
gentlemen outalivery, which has a riunion in my front par-

Godfather to the next little Plush as ever was.

I call the atenshn of Europ, in the most solomon and
unpressive manner, to the hinjaries infligted upon my

without receiving their wagis ; many of them is egsiles on

One of our borders, and a near relatif, by the Grand-

and don't bragg like some foax of my ginteal kinexions), is
a man wenerated in the whole prof eshn, and lookt up as one
of the fust yips in Europe. In this country (and from his
likeness when in his Vig to our rewered prelicks of the



PERSECUTION OF BRITISH FOOTMEN, 249

bentch of bishops) he was called Cantyberry — his reel
name being Thomas. You never sor a finer sight than Can-
tyberry on a levy day, a seated on his goold-fringed Ammer-
cloth ; a nozegy in his busm ; his little crisp vig curling
quite noble over his jolly red phase ; his At laced hallover
like a Hadmiral ; the white ribbings in his ands, the prans-
ing bay osses befor him; and behind, his state carridge;
with Marquiz and Marchyness of Jonquil inside, and the
galliant footmen in yalla livery clinging on at the back !
" Hooray ! " the boys used to cry hout, only to see Canty-
berry arrive. Every person of the extableshment called
him " Sir,'' his Master & Missis inklewdid. He never went
into the stayble, ixep to smoke a segar ; and when the state-
carridge was hordered (me and the Jonquils live close to-
gether, the W of F being sitiwated in a gluteal Court lead-
ing hout of the street), he sat in my front parlor, in full
phig, reading the newspaper like a Lord, until such time as
his body-suvn't called him, and said Lord and Lady Jonquil
was ready to sit behind him. Then he went. Not a minnit
sooner : not a minnit latter ; and being elped hup to the box
by 3 men, he took the ribbings, and drove his employers to
the ressadences of the nobillaty, or the pallis of the Sovring.

Times is now, E how much changed with Cantyberry !
Last yer, being bribed by Sir Thomas and Lady Kicklebury,
but chiefly, I fear, because this old gent, being intimat with
Butlers, had equired a tayste for Bergamy, and Clarick, and
other French winds, he quitted Lord and Lady Jonquil's
box for that of the Kicklebury famly, residing Eue Eivuly,
at Parris. He was rispected there — that Cantyberry is
wherehever he goes ; the King, the Hex-Kings coachmen,
were mear moughs compared to him ; and when he eard the
Kings osses were sold the other day at 50 frongs apease, he
says they was deer at the money.

Well, on the 24th of Febbywerrry, being so ableegin as
to drive Sir T. and Lady Kicklebury to dinner with the
Markee d'Epinard, in the Fobug Sang Jermang, Cantyberry,
who had been sittn all day reading Gallynanny, and playing
at cribbidge at a Marshong de Vang, and kawnsquinly was
quite hignorant of the ewents in progrice, found hisself all
of a sudding serowndid by a set of rewd fellers with pikes
and guns, hollerun and bellerin " Veevly liberty," ^^ Amove
Lewy-Philip," etc. — " Git out of the way there," says Can-
tyberry, from his box, a vipping his osses.

The puple, as the French people call theirselves, came
round the carridge, rawring out, " Ah Bah 1' Aristograt ! "



260 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

Lady Kicklebury looked hout. Her Par was in the Cheese
Mongering (olesale) way : and she never was called an aris-
tograt afor. " Your mistaken, my good people," says she ;
" Je swee Onglase. Wee, boco. Lady Kicklebury, je vey
diner avec Munseer d'Eppynar;'' and so she went arjab-
bring on; but I'm blest if the Puple would let her pass that
way. They said there was a barrygade in the street, and
turning round the Eds of Cantyberry's osses, told him to
drive down the next street. He didn't understand, but was
i-eddy to drop hofP his perch at the Hindignaty hoffered the
British Vip.

Now they had scarce drove down the next street at a
tarin gallop (for when aggrywated, Cantyberry drives like
madd, to be sure), when lowinbyold, they come on some
more puple, more pikes, more guns, the pavement hup, and
a Buss spilt on the ground, so that it was impawsable to
pass.

" Git out of the carridge," rors the puple, and a feller
in a cock at (of the Pollypicnic School, Cantyberry says,
though what that is he doant No) comes up to the door,
while bothers old the osses, and says, " Miladi, il f aut des
cendres ; " which means, you must git out.

" Mway ne vu pas, Moi Lady Kicklebury," cries out my
lady, waggling her phethers and diminds, and screamin like
a Macaw.

" II le fo pourtong," says the Pollypicnic scholard, very
polite, though he was reddy to bust with laffin hisself . " We
must make a barrygade of the carridge. The cavilry is at
one hend of the street, the hartillary at the other ; there '11
be a fight presently, and out you must git."

Lady Kicklebury set up a screamii;Lg louder than hever,
and I warrant she hopped out pretty quick this time, and
the hoffiser, giving her his harm, led her into a kimmis
shop, and giv her a glas of sallyvalattaly.

Meanwild Cantyberry sat puffin like a grampus on his
box, his face as red as Cielingwhacks. His osses had been
led out before his hi's, his footmen — French minials, un-
wuthy of a livry — had fratynized with the Mobb, and
Thomas Cantyberry sat aloan.

" Descends, mong gros ! " cries the mob (which intup-
prited is " Come down, old fat un ") ; " come off your box,
we're goin to upset the carridge."

" Never," says Thomas, for which he knew the French ; and
dubbling his phist, he igsclaimed, " Jammy, Dammy ! " He

cut the fust man wlio sprang hon the box, hover the fase
and i's ; he delivered on the nex fellers nob. But what was
Thomas Cantyberry against a people in harms ? They
pulled that brave old man hoff his perch. They upset his
carridge — his carridge beside a buss. When he comes to
this pint of his narratif , Thomas always busts into tears and
calls for a fresh glas.

He is to be herd of at my bar: and being disingaged
hoffers hisself to the Nobillaty for the enshuing seasn. His
tums is ninety lbs per hannum, the purchesing of the han-
nimals and the com, an elper for each two osses : ony to
drive the lord and lady of the famly, no drivin at night
except to Ofishl parties, and two vigs drest a day during
the seasn. He objex to the country, and won't go abrod
no more. In a country (sezee) where I was ableeged to
whonder abowt disguised out of livery, amongst a puple who
pulled my vig off before my face, Thomas will never mount
box agin.

And I eplaud him. And as long as he has enough to pay
his skaw, my house is a home for this galliant Hegsile.

Frederic Legs also moved us deaply ; we call him leggs,
from the bewty of those limbs of his, which from being his
pride and hornymint had neariy projuised his rewing.
When the town was in kemotion, and the furious French
Peuple pursewing every Henglish livary, Fredrick (in suv-
vice with a noble famly who shall be nameliss) put on a
palto and trowseys, of which his master made him a presnt,
and indeavored to fly.

He mounted a large tricolore cockade in his At, from
which he tor the lace, and tried as much as possable to
look like a siwillian. But it wouldn^t do. The clo's given
him by his X-master, who was a little mann, were too small
for Frederick — the bewty of his legs epeared through his
trowsies. The Rebublikins jeered and laft at him in the
streats; and it is a mussy that he ever reached Balone
alive.

I tried to cumsole Chawls by pinting out that the Art
which has truly loved never forgits, but as trewly loves on
to the clothes ; and that if Madamasell reely did love him
as he said, he had a better chans of winning her And now
than under a monarchickle and arastacrattic Guvment ; and
as for Frederic, I pinted out to him that a man of his ap-
pearants was safe of implymint and promoashn in any
country.

I did everythink, in a word, to sooth my frends. In a
noble speach I showed, that if others do wrong, that is no
reason why we shouldn't do right. " On the contry now is
the time," I said, " for Hengland to show she is reely the
Home of the World ; and that all men, from a Black to a
Frenchman, ought to be safe under the Banner of Brit-
tannier.

"The pholly of these consperracies and jellowsies, I think
may be pinted out to my feller-suvants, and igsemplafied
in the instants of the families of the Prince of Bovo, at
Parris, and of Lord Ycount Guttlebury, in this country.

" At Parris, As is well ascertained, the nobill Prins, who
kep a large studd of osses, with English groombs to take
care of em (as by natur Britns are formed to do that, and
everythink better than everybody) — the noble Prins, I say,
was called upon by the Puple to dishmiss his Hinglish oss-
keepers. ^Serviture,' says the Prince, 'Veeve la liberty;
let the Hosskeepers be turned out, as the Sovring Puple is
inimichael to their stoppin in France.' The Puple left the
Sitzen Prins with a chear for fratunnity, & the ppr groombs
packed up, and have come back to their native hilind.

" But what inshood ? The nex day, the Prins sent away
the hosses after the hosskeepers ; sold up the studd ; locked
up the carridges, broombs, cabs, bogeys (as those hignorant
French call buggiz), landores & all, and goes about now
with an umbereller. And how, I should lick to know, is
the puple any better for meddling ?

" Lord Ycount Guttlebury's is a case, dear frends, which
still mor comes hoam to our busms and our bisniss, and
has made no small sensatiun in the Plush and in the fash-
ionable wuld. The splender of his lodships entytainments
is well known. That good and uprike nobleman only lived
for wittles. And be ard on him ? why should we ? —
Nayter has implanted in our busum tastis of a thousand
diferent kinds. Some men have a pashn for fox-untin,
some like listening to dybatts in Parlymink and settn on
railrode committies ; some like Politticle Aconomy. I've
waited behind a chair and heerd foax talk about Jollagy,
Straty, and red sanstone, until I've nearly dropt asleap my-
self while standing a Santynel on jewty. What then ?
Give every man his taste, I say, and my Lord Guttlebury's
was his dinner.

" He had a French Hartist at the head of his Quizeen of
coarse — that sellabrated mann Munseer Supreme. Mun-
seer Sooflay persided hover the cumf eckshnary ; and under
Supraym were three young aidycongs : a Frenchman, a Bul-
gian, and a young feller from the City, who manidged the
tertle and wenson department.

" He was a clever young mann. He has hofn been to
take a glas at the W of F : and whenever he came with a
cassyrowl of clear turtle, or an ash wenison dish for my
Mary Hann, he was I'm sure always welcome. But John
Baster was henvious and hambishes. He jined the owtcry
which has been rose against foring suvants by some of our
bruthring, and he tl ought to get ridd of Supraym and the
other contynentials, and espired to be Chief Guvnor of my
lord's kitching.

" Forgitting every sentament but haytred of the forryner,
this envius raskle ingaged the kitching-boys and female
elpers (who, bein a hansum young mann, looked on him
with a kindly i) in a fowl conspirracy against the French-
men. He introjuiced kyang pepper into the patty s, garlick
into the Blemongys, and sent up the souffly flavored with
ingyans. He pysoned my lord's chocolate with shalott, he
put Tarrygin vinegar into the Hices. There never was

such a conwulsiou, or so horrid an igspreshn of hagny in a
man's, has (I'm told by my exlent friend, the Majordomy)
my lord's face ashumed, when he tasted black pepper in the
clear soup.

" The axdence occurred day after day. It was one day

when a E, ^1 P-ss-n-dge was dining with his loddship ;

another when 6 egsiled sovrings took their mutton (when
he didn't so much mind) ; a 3d when he wished to dine
more igspecially better than on any other, because the doctor
had told him to be careful, and he was dining by himself :
this last day drove him madd. He sent for Suprame, ad-
dresst that gentilman in languidge which he couldn't brook
(for he was a Major of the Nashnal Guard of his Betallian,
and Commander of the Legend of Honor), and Suprame
rasined on the spott — which the French and the Bulgian
did it too.

" Soufflay and the cumf ectioners hemigrated the nex day.
And the house steward, who has a heasy master, for Lord
G. is old, fibble, and 70 years of hage, and whose lady has
an uncommon good apinnion of Master Baster, recom-
mended him to the place, or at least to have the Purvisional
Guvment of my lord's Quizeen.

" It wasn't badd. Baster has tallint of no mien horder.
You couldn't egsactly find folt with his souperintendiance.
But a mere good dinner is fur from enough to your true
amature. A dellixy, a something, 2, jenny squaw ^ constatutes
the diffrants between talint and Genus — and my lord
soughered under it. He grew melumcolly and silent ; he
dined, its trew, taysting all the ontrays as usual, but he
never made any remarx about 'em, for good or for bad.
Young Baster at the Igth of his Hambishn, tor his Air
with rage as his dinners came down 1 by 1, and nothing
was said about 'em — nothing.

" Lord Guttlebury was breaking his Art, He didn' know
how fond he was of Supraym till he lost him — how nes-
sasurry that mann was to his igsistence. He sett his con-
fidenshle Valick to find out where Supraym had retreated ;
and finding he was gone to Gascony, of which he is a naytif,
last weak without saying a word to his frends, with only
Sangsew his valet, and the flying ketching fourgong, without
which he never travels — my lord went to France and put
himself again under Supraym. The scan between 'em, I'm
told, was very affecting. My lord has taken a Shatto near
Supraym's house, who comes to dress the dinner of which
the noble Ycount partakes aloan.

" The town-house is shet up, and everybody has ad orders
to quit — all the footmen — all the quizeen, in coarse includ-
ing Baster — and this is all he has gained by his insidjus
haytrid of "forraners, and by his foolish hambishn.

" No, my friends," I concluded ; " if gentlemen choose to
have foreign suvnts, it's not for us to intafear, and there
must be a free trayd in flunkies as in every other kimodaty

Since the days of

such days of peace,

as those that are

There will be a Capital.

The Ambassadors of the foreign Powers will bring their

The nobility will flock back in crowds to our deserted
squares. Irish Poplin will rise in price to ten shillings a
yard, so vast will be the demand for that web by the ladies
of our city. Irish diamonds will reach the price of the in-
ferior Goleonda article. Irish linen and shirtings will rise
immensely. Indeed, all Irish produce, not being depre-




IRISH GEMS. 259

ciated by the ruinous competition for gold, will augment in
value.

Debt at home, and absenteeism, have been the curses of
our country. Henceforth there shall be no absenteeism,
and no debt.

He who refuses to live amongst us is not of us. The
soil is for the inhabitants of the soil.

I have already, my dear friends, instructed you in the
manner in which every one of you may get a cheap and
handsome property for himself, viz., by holding possession
of that which you at present occupy. For, as every man
has an indefeasible right to subsistence, and as Nature pro-
duces for the good of all, it is manifestly right that the
many should have the possession, and not the few.

If a landlord should object to this arrangement (who is
but a mere accident on the face of the earth), for the love
of God, boys, get rifles and blow his brains out. It is much
better that a few landlords should perish, and their families
(who have been living on the fat of the land hitherto, and
may therefore take a turn of ill-fortune) should starve,
than that multitudes should die of want.

And thus the curse of quarter-day will be removed at
once from this island: and after a very little necessary
slaughter. For depend upon it, that when two or three
landlords have been served in the way recommended by
me, the rest will not care to be pressing for rents. The
butchers who govern us instituted the system of hanging
for this very reason : arguing, that one example before Kil-
mainham deterred numbers of waverers ; and we may be
sure that the rifle, rightly employed, will act upon an aris-
tocrat just as well as upon a housebreaker ; for, are not men
mew, whether clad in Saxon ermine, or in the rude frieze-
coats of our miserable fatherland ? Out with your rifles,
boys, in the name of humanity !

They say that the property of Ireland is mortgaged in a
great degree, and for the most part to the brutal Saxon
shopkeepers and pedlars. You will have the advantage of
getting your land entirely free ; there will be no manacle
of debt to weigh down the free arms which are henceforth
to till the beloved soil of our country.

And the land being unencumbered, you will have the
further advantage of being able to invite capitalists to aid
you with money to conduct the operations of agriculture.
Glorious America, which sympathizes with you sincerely,

will be much more ready to lend its capital upon unencum-
bered than on encumbered property. And we shall nego-
tiate loans in her magnificent commercial cities, where I
have no doubt there will be a noble emulation to come to
the aid of a free Irish nation.

The idea of sending cattle and pigs to England, to feed
Saxon ruffians, is then to be scouted henceforth by all hon-
est Irishmen. We will consume our own beef and pork by
our own firesides. There is enough live-stock in this island
to give every regenerate Irishman good meals of meat for
the next year ensuing; and our lands, notoriously the
greenest and most fertile in the world, will have fed up a
similar quantity by the year 1850. Thus, we shall never
want henceforth ; and while we fatten and flourish, we shall
see the Saxon enemy decay.

And as the beef-fed scoundrels cannot live upon cotton
and hardware, we shall have the satisfaction of reducing
the prices of those commodities, and getting them at a
much more reasonable rate than that at which the accursed
moneymongers now vend them.



FROM THE "united IRISHWOMAN.'^
The Duties of our Women,

In the coming time the weapon nearest at hand is always
the cheapest. Only dilettanti go about picking and choos-
ing. Shilly-shallyers are cowards. Brave men are always
armed.

Brave men and brave women, a few suggestions to house-
keepers we have already given ; we could supply thousands
more.

There is no better weapon, for instance, than one which
is to be found in every house in the refined quarter of the
metropolis. A grand piano sent down upon a troop of hus-
sars will play such a sonata over their heads as the scoun-
drels never marched off to. A chimney-glass is a rare
thing for smashing. I should not like to be the Saxon
assassin upon whom some white-armed girl of Erin flung it.

Pokers and tongs everybody will know the use of. A
cut-steel fender is an awkward thing for a dragoon to ride
over. A guardsman won't look well with a copper coal-
scuttle for a helmet.



IRISH GEMS. 261

Ladies' linen will make the best of lint. A laced hand-
kerchief tied round a wounded warrior's brow will be well
bestowed. I have seen a servant in college knocked down
by a glossy boot, ever so slight, of varnished leather : if a
footman, why not a private soldier ? Have at him, ladies,
from the bedroom windows. Your husbands will be away
yonder at the barricades.

A hot saddle of mutton, flung by cook into the face of a
bawling Saxon Colonel, will silence him ; send the dish-
cover with it ; or at tea-time try him with the silver tea-
urn. Our wife has one. She longs for an opportunity to
fling it, heater and all, into a Saxon face.

Besides the bottle-rack, the use of which and its contents
are evident, your husband will leave the keys of the cellar
with you, and you know what to do. Old port makes excel-
lent grape-shot ; and I don't know any better use which
you can make of a magnum of Latouche than to floor an
Englishman with it. Have at them with all the glasses in
your house, the china, the decanters, the lamps, and the
cut-glass chandelier.

A good large cheese would be found rather indigestible
by a Saxon, if dropped on his nose from a second story.
And the children's washing-tub artfully administered may
do execution. EecoUect, it is a tub to catch a whale.

There is a lady in Leeson Street who vows to fling her
Angola cat and her pet spaniel at the military while en-
gaged there. The cat may escape (and it is not the first
time the Saxon ruffians have tasted its claws). The Blen-
heim cost her twenty-five guineas. She will give that or
anything else for her country.

The water-pipes will be excellent things to tear up and
launch at the enemy. They may make a slop in the house
at first, but the mains and the gas will be let off. The ruf-
fians shall fight us, if they dare, in darkness and drought.

You will of course empty the china-closets on the rascals,
and all the bedroom foot-baths and washing-basins. Have
them ready, and the chests of drawers balancing on the
window-sills. Send those after them too.

And if any coward Saxon bullet pierces the fair bosom of
a maid or a wife of Erin, may the curses of Heaven light
on the butcherly dastard ! May the pikes of Erin quiver
in his writhing heart, the bullets of Erin whirl through his
screaming eyeballs ! May his orphans perish howling, and
his true love laugh over his grave ! May his sister's fair

fame be blighted, and his grandmother held up to scorn !
May remorse fang him like a ban-dog, and cowardice whip
him like a slave ! May life weary him ! death dishonor,

STEEMED SIR: Seldom
directly meddHng with
politics, I ofEer a humble
but particularly warm ad-
hesion to the principles
of your programme for
the 24th. Any services
IE my line I beg you to
command. I believe that
the country is not fairly
represented, and that
Lord This coerced his
voters at Stamford, while
Mr. That purchased his
at Kinsdde. I black-
balled Captain Fitzwhis-
kers at the club last
week with perfect satis-
faction, and without risk
personal collision with
the Captain, who is since gone abroad, and I do not see
why Lord Exeter's tenants should not have a similar mod-
est way of asserting their opinions. If ballot is an un-
English practice, I hope it will soon be an English one.
If there were more parliaments, and more voters, I think
there would be less bribery, and that even Mr. Attwood
could not stand persuading electors too often, I stand by
you respectfully, and am ready to adopt any peaceful and
constitutional line of agitation which you shall think ad-
visable.

" If Lord John Russell will not come with us, I can con-
ceive (with infinite pain) the possibility of doing without

him. I had rather have bribery decreased than Lord John
Russell at the head of affairs. I had rather that landlords
should cease to bully, even, than that Lord John should
continue to be our chief. I can fancy that the world will
go on even without him, and that the machine will not fall
to pieces although this prodigious little pin be withdrawn.
Let it have a coronet, gilt on its head, and be stuck in a
cushion in the House of Lords.

" I can even go some length with Mr. Cobden in his dan-
gerous speech about the barbarous splendor surrounding
the Crown. It is not the money, as some people object, so
much as the sentiment. It will make very little difference
to any man in England whether there is a silver stick or
groom of the dust-pan more or less in the service of the
Court, of which we all admire the modest English merits.
But there are barbarous splendors about the precincts of
Pimlico, that are ridiculous and immoral, rather than costly,
against which Mr. Cobden has a right to cry out. Who
could not name a score such ?

" It is very well for Lord John to cry out and say that
the British people love their Queen, that they will not
grudge her any of the state which belongs to her dignity,
that she is a model of private virtue, and that to meddle
with her privileges is to meddle with the Constitution.
What is the Constitution, my dear Sir, d'abord ? If the Con-
stitution of to-day is the Constitution of the Prince Re-
gent's time, every gentleman connected with this periodical
would have passed years in jail, as Mr. Leigh Hunt did.
Good Laws ! how have we ridiculed a certain august hat,
for instance : not because we are disloyal, but because the
object was laughworthy. In Queen Anne's reign we should
have had our ears cut off ; by Queen Elizabeth we should
have been hanged without mercy, and all under the exer-
cise of the same Constitution. The Constitution roasted us
indifferently for being Catholics or Protestants. If the
Constitution is at the head of the nation, it is not Britan-
nia's helmet, as it were, but her hair : it renews itself per-
petually : it is cut off and grows again, and is curled in a
thousand fashions — fashions is the word — the Constitu-
tion is the political fashion. The country may wear what
she likes — ringlets, or powder and a tail, or a Madonna
bandeau, or a Brutus crop.

" And as for insinuating that a man is disrespectful to
his Queen because he wishes to alter some of the present



ON THE NEW FORWARD MOVEMENT. 265

appurtenances of Royalty, I take the liberty to deny that
charge with indignation. For instance, I love and respect
my grandmother ; but suppose she took it into her head to
walk in the Park with a hoop and falbalas, and the second
headdress above described, should we not have a right to
remonstrate with the venerable lady ? Cobden has a right
to look at the Court and say that many parts of it are bar-
barous and foolish. Beef-eaters are barbarous. Court-Cir-
culars are barbarous. Gentlemen-Pensioners are barbarous.
Jones with a black satin bag going to Court with his sword
between his legs is barbarous. My old friend, Jeames,
with his stick and bouquet, is an eminent and absurd bar-
barian. I hope to see them all sacrificed ; and as for poor
Jeames, I am like Mitchel and Lord Clarendon, and ex-
claim, * Either you or I must die, Jeames.'

"The day after the Drawing-Room, as I was walking
down Pall Mall (with Colonel Blucher and young High-
lows, a relation of Wellington's, by the way), the Lord
Mayor's coach passed down the astonished street, escorted
by policemen, his Lordship, and the man who wears the
muff, being inside ; the Court of Aldermen and the Common
Council, with blue gowns, following their Chief in various
cabs, broughams, and other vehicles.

" When the hideous, monstrous, creaking, tumbling, lum-
bering old trap was built, in which his Lordship was seated,
it was made after the fashion of the times, when people
liked to travel slow, and was no doubt the best vehicle of a
large sort which could be manufactured. Since then, rail-
roads have learned to travel seventy miles an hour, and
there's not a dustman's cart that doesn't go better than
the wretched old mammoth coach, with its huge, old, ugly,
clumsy, costly machinery, containing a magistrature just as
costly, clumsy, and out of date. The little civilized boys
in Pall Mall * larked ' the Lord Mayor and his friend in the
muff ; the street-sweeper looked at him with scorn, and the
Policemen marched with downcast faces as the carriage
rumbled into the City, stopping up the way, annoying the
passengers, interrupting the traffic, and occasioning general
discomfort.

" Suppose the House of Commons had a jurisdiction, and
should propose the civic rattle-trap should be abolished, or
a new and more commodious carriage provided for the Lord
Mayor. But my Lord John replies, * Beware of Republi-
canism. Dangerous innovations are being practised every-

where. The people, it is my firm belief, are satisfied with
their present institutions ; and I have the happiness of
thinking that the Lord and Lady Mayoress are the most
excellent persons in their private capacity, and their private
virtues exalt their lofty station. [Hear.] Her Ladyship
attends to the household duties ; never breakfasts in bed ;
looks to the tradesmen's books and the housekeeping ; sees
to the children in the nurseiy, and walks out with her
ladies of honor, in the pleasure-grounds of Billingsgate or
Bunhill Kow. His lordship has prayers in the morning;
does Justice business all day ; dispenses hospitality in the
evening ; but is never more than half an hour away from
the ladies over his wine. [Immense cheers, in which Mr.
Hudson and Mr. Brotherton join.] And this being the
case, what follows ? Why, the consequence is obvious :
they are virtuous, therefore they oughtn't to have a new
coach. The old one has borne for two hundred years the
bottle and the breeze. It rolls, and as it roUs, forever will
roll on.' [Immense cheers.]

"It was exactly the argument pursued in France by other
little statesmen and ministers of a moral monarch. ^ Louis-
Philippe is a model husband and father ; therefore don't let
us have any more reforms. Who dares say that this mon-
arch does not sympathize with the country, when it is
known that he takes tea and plays his rubber in the bosom
of his family like the simplest bourgeois ? What can the
people want with public meetings, when the king sleeps on
a straw mattress, and is a pattern of domestic propriety ?
Keforms, forsooth! Haven't we a Chamber, and an im-
mense majority ? ' This was the argument up to the
twenty-third of last February ; but it had ceased to be very
cogent on the twenty-fifth, when majority, monarch, and
ministers had all disappeared from the scene.

" And this point being, rather brutally, disposed of, there
comes another argument, which people are very fond of
putting, and is used by your Conservatives and Whigs with
a triumphant air. * Yes ; they have got rid of their monarch
and ministers,' says Lord Johnny or Lord Tommy ; ^ but
what have they taken in exchange ? A howling democ-
racy ; a furious tyranny of 500,000 bayonets ; a ruined Ex-
chequer; a national bankruptcy; a general cessation of
labor ; and conspiracy to organize famine. Does not every
man of sense prefer the moderate liberty of Louis-Philippe
to the monstrous licentiousness, and the constant danger



ON THE NEW FORWARD MOVEMENT. 267

and terror of the present period ? Would you have wild
revolutionists yelling in London streets, and clubs and
muskets governing the House of Representation ? ' The
meaning of which is that a man should forego his un-
doubted rights for the sake of peace and quiet, rather than
that he should bestir and endanger himself to gain them.

" But in this case Mr. Bancroft would never have been
here as American Minister, that is clear ; and the American
colonies would be still paying their tax upon tea. We might
still have had Stuarts on the throne, chopping off heads of
Lord Russells for treason. The cause for which Hampden
and Sidney still occasionally perish after dinner, in those
weak assemblies where the Whigs muster, was a rank rebel-
lion ; and Mr. Barry should design a Star Chamber in the
new Houses of Parliament, where the dandy dealers in
middle-age gimcracks were afraid to set up Cromwell. Of
course, no revolution is good for trade. People can't do
two things at a time. It is impossible at once to work at a
stocking-loom and in a riot. But who is the cause of the
riot ? What was it brought Louis-Philippe smirking over
the barricades of July, when all danger was over, and put
him into a cab, and sent him out of the Paris gates in Feb-
ruary ? What was it brought Lord John into office in '32,
and will send him out before many months are over ? He
can't stop, and keep all the world waiting behind him. He
is at the head of the column, and must march with it, or
shirk out of the rank and let it pass by, or stand and let it
march over him.

"In a country where there is a Press, Eailroads, and Free
Discussion, there is no need to have a fight at all. There
must be two parties to fight ; and the weaker one, which
would lose most by the battle too, never will. And they
may talk of a good cause as inspiriting a man to battle;
but what can be more inspiriting than to know not only
that your cause is good, but that your enemy is sure to run
away without fighting ?

" It is to this I look, this which brings me with ardor to
your ranks, and this prophecy, which I beseech you to re-
member in the hour of victory."

MIS CELL A NEO US CONTRIBUTIONS,




MR. SNOB'S EEMONSTRANCE WITH MR. SMITH.

1848.

MY DEAR SMITH, — When we
last met at the Polyanthus Club,
you showed me so remarkably cold a
shoulder, that I was hurt by your
change of behavior, and inquired the
cause of the alteration. You are a
kind and excellent friend, and used to
tip me when I was a boy at school ;
and I was glad to find that you had
public and not private causes for your diminished cordial-
ity. Jones imparted to me your opinion that a previous
letter of mine in this periodical was of so dangerous and
disloyal a character, that honest men should avoid the
author. He takes leave to exculpate himself through the
same medium.

All our difference, my dear sir, is as to the method of
displaying loyalty. Without fulsome professions for the
virtuous and excellent young matron and lady who fills the
Throne nowadays, one may feel that those private virtues
and excellences are amongst her noblest titles of honor, and,
without in the least implicating the royal personage seated
in it, quarrel with the taste of some of the ornaments of the
Throne. I do believe that some of these are barbarous,
that they often put the occupant of that august seat in a
false and ridiculous position, and that it would be greatly
to the advantage of her dignity if they were away.

You recollect our talk at the Polyanthus, relative to the
private letters which passed between Louis-Philippe and the
Sovereign of this country, which the present French Govern-
ment has thought fit to republish. " Why," said you, " did
they condescend to make public these private letters ?
What could it matter to Europe to know whether, in the
voyage from Dover to Calais, ' my poor Montpensier ' was
dreadfully sick, and the King did not suffer at all ? " Royal



MR. SNOB'S REMONSTRANCE, 269

families must have their talk and gossip, like any other
domestic circles. Why placard the town with this harm-
less private gossip, and drag innocent people into public-
ity ? And, indeed, with the exception of that pretty letter
to the Princess Royal (in which her " old cousin," Louis
Philippe, announces to her his present of a doll with six-
and-twenty suits of clothes, and exhibits himself very ami-
ably and artlessly for once, as a kind-hearted old grand-
father and gentleman), it is a pity that the whole corre-
spondence were not consigned to the bottom of that ocean
which made " my poor Montpensier " so unwell.

But if the privacy of royalty is not to be intruded upon,
why is it perpetually thrust in our faces ? Why is that
Court Newsman not stifled ? I say that individual is one
of the barbarous adjuncts of the Crown whom we ought to
abolish, and whom it is an honest man's duty to hoot off
the stage. I say it is monstrous, immodest, unseemly, that
in our time such details should occupy great columns of the
newspapers, as that of a Eoyal Christening, for instance,
which appeared the other day, in which you read as fol-
lows : —

" His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales was dressed in sky-blue velvet
embroidered with gold. The dress of Prince Alfred was of white and
silver, and the three Princesses were all dressed alike in frocks of Brit-
ish lace, in imitation of Mechlin lace, with flounces of the same over white
satin.

" His Royal Highness Prince Albert and the Duke of Wellington were
habited in the uniform of Field-Marshals ; the Prince wore the collars of
the Garter and the Bath, and the ensigns of the Golden Fleece.

*' The Royal infant was dressed in a robe of Honiton lace over white
satin, and was attended by the Dowager Lady Lyttelton. Her Royal
Highness was carried by the head nurse."

Gracious goodness ! is it bringing ridicule on the Throne
to say that such details as these are ridiculous ? Does it
add to the dignity of the greatest persons in this country
that other citizens should be told that Prince Alfred wore
white and silver, and the little Princesses were all dressed
alike in frocks of British lace, in imitation of Mechlin, with
flounces of the same, over white satin ? Suppose their
Koyal Highnesses wore their frocks inside out, what the
deuce does it matter to us ? These details may interest
Mr. Mantalini, but not men in England. They should not
be put before us. Why do we still laugh at people for kiss-
ing the Pope's toe, or applaud Macartney's British spirit
in the last age, for refusing kotoo to the Emperor of China ?



270 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

This is just as bad as kotoo. Those people degrade the
Throne who do not remove from it these degrading Middle-
Age ceremonials — as barbarous, as absurd, as unreasonable
as Queen Quashymaboo's cocked-hat and epaulets, or King
Mumbo-Jumbo's glass beads and tinsel.

When the procession of the sponsors and her Majesty's
procession had passed, and the Queen and the other royal
personages were conducted to their seats, the following
chorale was performed — such a chorale as was seldom pre-
sented to an infant before : —

" In life's gay mom, ere sprightly youth
By sin and folly is enslaved,
Oh, may the Maker's glorious name
Be on thy infant mind engraved !
So shall no shade of sorrow cluud
The sunshine of thy early days,
But happiness, in endless round,
Shall still encompass all thy ways.''

Now, Mr. Smith, on your honor and conscience, does the
publication of stuff like this add to, or diminish, the splen-
dor of the Throne ? Is it true, that if, in " the morning of
youth,'' the Princess is brought up piously, she is sure of
endless happiness to " encompass all her ways " ? Who
says so ? Who believes it ? Does it add to your respect
for the Head of the State, to represent her Majesty to your
imagination surrounded by Bishops, Marshals, and Knights
in their collars. Gold Sticks, Sponsor-proxies, and what not,
seated in the place of Divine Worship listening to such
inane verses ? No ; the disrespect is not on our side who
protest. No ; the disloyalty is with those who acquiesce
in ceremonies so monstrous and so vain. Archbishop, is
this the way people should renounce the pomps and vani-
ties of this wicked world ? It is these ceremonies which
set more people against you and your like, than all your
sermons can convince, or your good example keep faithful.

And I say that we are, Mr. Punch and all, a loyal and
affectionate people, and that we exult when we see the
great personages of the Crown worthily occupied. Take
the meeting of last Thursday, for instance, for the Improve-
ment of the Laboring Classes, at which his Koyal Highness
the Prince attended and spoke.

/* Depend upon it that the interests of often contrasted classes are iden-
tical, and it is only ignorance which prevents their uniting to the advan-



MR. SNOB'S REMONSTRANCE. 271

tage of each other. [Cheers.] To dispel that iguorance, and to show how
man can help man, notwithstanding the complicated state of civilized so-
ciety, ought to be the aim of every philanthropic person. [Loud cheers.]
This is more peculiarly the duty of those who, under the blessing of Divine
Providence, enjoy station, wealth, and education." [Cheers.l

Every man who heard, that, I say, cheered with all his
heart. "These are imperial words, and worthy kings."
There is no Gold Stick in this empire, no Vice-Chamberlain,
Groom of the Stole, Hereditary Grand Dancing Master, or
Quarterly Waiter in Waiting, that will yield to Mr. Punch
and your humble servant in loyalty, when words such as
these are spoken, and in such a spirit : and it is in tasks
like these that princes must busy themselves if in our times
they ask for loyalty from others or security for themselves.
The hold of the great upon us now is by beneficence, not
by claptraps and ceremonies. The people is and knows it-
self to be the stronger. Wisdom, simplicity, affection, must
be the guardians of the English Throne ; and may God
keep those Gentlemen-ushers about the Court of Queen
Victoria !

lONEL DE BOOTS was

the son of Lord and Lady
de Booterstown, and one
of the most elegant young
men of this or any age or
country His figure was
tall and slim ; his features
beauteous although not
more than eighteen years
of age, he could spell
with surprising correct-
ness and had a sweet yel-
low tuft growing on his
chm already!

A pattern of every ex-
cellence and brought up
under a fond mother's eye,
Lionel had all the budding virtues, and none of the odious
vices contracted by youth. He was not accustomed to take
more than three glasses of wine ; and though a perfect
Nimrod in the chase, as I have heard his dear mamma re-
mark, he never smoked those horrid cigars while going to
hunt.

He received his Commission in the Royal Horse Guards
Pink (Colonel Gizzard), and was presented, on his appoint-
ment, on the birthday of his Sovereign. His fond mamma
clasped her mailed warrior to her bosom, and wept tears of
maternal love upon his brilliant cuirass, which reflected her
own lovely image.



YESTERDAY: A TALE OF THE POLISH BALL. 273

But besides that of her ladyship, there was another
female heart which beat with affection's purest throb for
the youthful Lionel. The lovely Frederica de Toffy
(whose appearance at Court this year created so thrilling a
sensation) had long been designed by her eminent parents,
the Earl and Countess of Hardybake, to wed one day with
the brilliant heir of the house of De Boots.

Frederica nearly fainted with pleasure when her Lionel
presented himself at Alycampayne House in his charming
new uniform. " My military duties now call me," said the
gallant youth, with a manly sigh. " But 'twill not be long
ere next we meet. Remember thou art my partner in
Lady Smigsmag's Quadrille at the Polish Ball. Au revoir
— adieu ! " Emotion choked further utterance, and, stag-
gering from the presence of Love, Lionel hastened to join
his regiment at Kn-ghtshr-dge.

That night, as the Cavaliers of the Horse Guards Pink
sate in their tents, carousing to the health of their lady-
loves, news came from the Commander-in-Chief that Eng-
land had need of her warriors. The Chartists had risen !
They were in arms in Clerkenwell and Pentonville. " Up,
Cavaliers ! '' said the noble De Gizzard, quaffing a bumper
of Ypocras. "Gentlemen of the Horse Guards Pink, to
arms ! " Calling his battle-cry, Lionel laced on his morion ;
his trusty valet-de-chambre placed it on the golden curls of
his young master. To draw his sword, to recommend him-
self to Heaven and Sweet Saint Willibald, and to mount
his plunging charger, was the work of a moment. The
next — and the plumes of the Horse Guards Pink might be
seen waving in the midnight down the avenues of the Park,
while the clarions and violins of the band pealed forth the
National Anthem of Britons.

Lionel's mother had taken heed that the chamber which
he was to occupy at the barracks was comfortably arranged
for her young soldier. . Every elegant simplicity of the toi-
let had been provided. " Take care that there be bran in
his foot-bath," she said to his old servitor (pointing at the
same time to a richly-chased silver-gilt hain de pieds, em-
blazoned with the crest of the De Bootses). And she had
netted with her own hand a crimson silk night-cap with a
gold tassel, which she entreated — nay, commanded him to
wear. She imaged him asleep in his war-chamber. " May
my soldier sleep well," she exclaimed mentally, " till the
ringing trump of morn wake up my gallant boy ! "



274 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

Frederica, too, as far as modest maiden may, thought of
her Lionel. "-4A, Crinolinette," she said to her maid, in the
French language, of which she was a mistress, " Ah, que
ma galant G-ardende-vie puisse bien dormir ce nuit ! "

Lionel slept not on that night — not one wink had the
young soldier. In the moon, under the stars, in the cold
cold midnight, in the icy dawn, he and his gallant comrades
patrolled the lanes of Clerkenwell. Now charging a pulk
of Chartists — now coming to the aid of a squadron of
beleaguered Policemen — now interposing between the in-
furiate mob and the astonished Specials — everywhere Lio-
nel's sword gleamed. In the thick of the melee his voice
was heard encouraging the troops and filling the Chartists
with terror. "Oh," thought he, "that I could measure
steel with Fussell, or could stand for five minutes point to
point with Cuffey ! '' But no actual collision took place,
and the Life Guards Pink returned to their barracks at
dawn, when Colonel Gizzard sent off a most favorable re-
port to the Commander-in-Chief of the gallantry of young
De Boots.

The warriors cared not for rest that day. A night in the
saddle is no hardship to the soldier ; though Lionel, feeling
the approaches of a cold and sore throat, only took a little
water-gruel and lay down for a half-an-hour to recruit him-
self. But he could not sleep — he thought of Frederica !
" To-night I shall see her," he said. 'Twas the night of
the Polish Ball, and he bade his valet procure from Ham-
mersmith the loveliest bouquet for Frederica, consisting of
the rosy Magnolia, the delicate Polyanthus, and the droop-
ing and modest Sunflower.

The banquet of the Horse Guards Pink was served at
eight o'clock, and Lionel, to be ready for the ball, dressed
himself in pumps and pantaloons, with an embroidered
gauze chemise and a mere riband of lace round his neck.
He looked a young Apollo as he sat down to dine !

But scarce had he put the first spoonful of potage a la
reine to his ruby lips, when the clarion again sounded to
arms. " Confusion," said the gallant Gizzard, " the Char-
tists are again in arms, and we must forth." The banquet
was left untasted, and the warriors mounted their steeds.

So great was the hurry, that Lionel only put on his
helmet and cuirass, and rode forth in his evening dress.
'Twas a pitiless night ; the rain descended ; the winds
blew icy cold ; the young soldier was wet to the skin ere
the Guards debouched on Clerkenwell Green.



YESTERDAY: A TALE OF THE POLISH BALL. 275

And at that hour Frederica was looking out of the left
window at Almack's, waiting for Lionel.

Hours and hours he sat on his war-steed through that
long night — the rain descended, the wind was more chilly,
the dastard Chartists would not face the steel of the Loyal
Cavaliers of the Horse Guards Pink, but fled at the sight
of our warriors. Ah ! 'twas a piteous night !

Frederica was carried at daybreak to Alycampayne
House from the ball. She had not danced all that night ;
she refused the most eligible partners, for she could only
think of her Cavalier ; her Lionel, who never came ! Her
mamma marked her child's frenzied eye and hectic cheek,
and shuddered as she put her daughter to bed, and wrote a
hurried note to Dr. L— c— ck.

At that hour, too, the Horse Guards Pink returned to
their barracks. The veterans were unmoved ; but, ah me !
for the recruits ! Lionel was in a high fever — two nights'
exposure had struck down the gallant boy — he was deli-
rious two hours after he was placed in bed! "Mamma!
Frederica ! " he shouted —

Last Saturday two hearses — the one bearing the helm
and arms of a young warrior, and the escutcheon of the
De Bootses, the other the lozenge of the Alycampaynes,
wound their way slowly to Highgate Cemetery. Lionel
and Frederica were laid in the same grave! But how
much of this agony might have been spared if the odious
Chartists would but have stayed at home, or if that young
couple had taken from twelve to fourteen of Morison's
Universal Pills, instead of the vile medicine with which
" the Faculty " killed them !

LETTERS TO A NOBLEMAN VISITING IRELAND.
I.

the time this affectionate
letter reaches your Lord-
ship, you will have had
an opportunity of person-
ally inspecting that beau-
tiful Island of Ireland,
which occupies us so much,
and which we all love so.
I also have had the good
fortune to see it, and have
my own sentiments regard-
■ ing it, sentiments which
I will gladly confide to
your Lordship's private
ear, and which I have no
doubt will become general in England before long, however
unpopular they may at present be.

" However, you are at headquarters, and can get at the
actual truth about Ireland from the people themselves.
^ Indeed, I don't know anything so easy to get at in Ireland.
I should say if there was any one virtue which character-
ized the people, a love of truth was that merit. You may,
if you like, rely upon every single word that ever^ single
Irishman tells you, and placing implicit credit m their
statements, the task of governing them will become both
easy and pleasant. It was by a steady perseverance in the
truth, and a skilful arrangement of fa«ta, that the great
O'Connell attained his influence over his enlightened coun-
trymen. But why enlarge on this? You yourself, my
Lord, knew and were fond of that great man. You gave
his sons places, made himself offers of preferment ; and
when by a combination of misfortunes he was locked up
in jail, your party nobly aided in letting him out of prison.

" You will find the respected Roman Catholic clergymen
distinguished for straightforwardness and candor. Their
conduct throughout the late disturbance has been frank
and manly : I protest, for instance, I know nothing more
amiable than the interposition of the Tuam clergy apropos
of the late great rebellion. Modesty, Truth, and Charity
figure in every line of their composition.

" * Rest assured, the heart of Ireland is sound and true
towards your Gracious Majesty — hence we implore, we
entreat, nay, we most humbly beg — " no blood " ; and as
ministers of religion, whose sacred duty it is to inculcate
peace and good will amongst men, we further beg to assure
your Majesty that the concession of the prayer of this our
petition shall be an additional stimulant to us to uphold
the laws, and to secure, even at the sacrifice of our lives,
the stability of that Throne which is so happily occupied
by your Most Gracious Majesty.'

" No, no, * no blood ; ' their Reverences can't bear it ; and
our government must forego its known desire for shedding
It. No, * no blood ; ' let those good folks rescue the lambs
from the butcher. ' Even at the sacrifice of their lives '
they will be loyal. See with what generous openness they
speak — without arriere-pensee. They will be loyal, what-
ever you can do. Though you were to shoot half of them
(and you know you have some notion of the kind), the rest
would sing ' Domine salvum.' No, no blood ; restrain your
appetite for it, too truculent and sanguinary statesman !

" I would suggest a little more than a mere forbearance
of revenge — I would conciliate. I would have the oflB.cer
broke, for example, of whom Mr. Marr complained for hav-
ing drilled in his grounds, and dared to protect his property,
at Thurles. I would have the policeman shot who fired
upon those honest fellows at Boulagh Common. Compen-
sation ought to be given to the innocent victims who fell
there. And something handsome should be done for the
leaders, under whom the people ' declined to act.' Send
the young gentlemen of Pim's out of jail, with leave to
wear their uniforms behind the counter; let the colonels
and field-officers of the (so-called) rebel army retire on half-
pay — but no blood. Odds butchers and shambles! No
blood. If we English have a fault, it is that love of mur-
der — and on whom do we practise it ? On a most inno-
cent, simple, loyal, jury-loving, truth-telling, pike-hating,
pistol-loathing, blunderbuss-dreading people, that never har-
bored a thought of evil.

By heavens, Sir, I see no end to the benefits which a union
with them confers upon our country !

" During your visit, and as there is no food in Ireland to
last the people beyond January, I hope you will call the
Irish gentry together, and get from them a round state-
ment of the sum which they would like us to pay for the
next year's maintenance of their people. There is nothing
like having a fair statement of accounts. Let it be well
understood in England that we are to support the Irish for
the next ten, twenty, or hundred years (for indeed there is
no end to the prospect), because then we shall know how
to cut our coats according to our cloths, and apportion our
rations to the number of feeders. If for the rest of my
working days I am to have the inestimable pleasure of re-
ceiving a grateful and agreeable Irishman every day at my
dinner, let me know, so that means may be got ready to
accommodate this charming boarder.

" Repeal the Union, indeed ! Restore the Heptarchy !
Let it be well understood that we will never part from the
Irish, and that we are prepared to feed them forever and
ever. No, Sir ; we won't part with the Emerald Gem of
the Western Wave, which now forms the brightest Jewel
of the British Crown.

" By the way, in personally inspecting it, your Lordship
will remember how, eighty years since. Lord Chatham de-
clared the North American Colonies to be the most elegant
ornaments of the diadem in question ; and that our utter
national smash and annihilation would ensue, if we lost
those appendages.

" Now it is certain that in spite of the above prophecy,
the English empire is not a bit the less handsome, splendid,
or valuable, although these Colonies are taken from it ; that
it is a thousand times more pleasant and profitable to us
to trade with the United States, than to bully the North
American Provinces ; and that if we had thrashed Mr.
Washington utterly, as any general of common brains might
have done a score of times, hanged him and Mr. Franklin,
and kept the other brightest jewel to the present day, we
should have been by no means so well off as we are at this
moment of time.

" Suppose anybody were to offer us back Normandy and



TO A NOBLEMAN VISITING IRELAND. 279

Picardy, which undoubtedly were ours once, and which, with
the whole of France, indeed, belonged to Her Majesty's
grandfather, as we read upon the coins of the first forty
years of his reign — would we take them as presents ? We
had rather not. It would be thank you for nothing. A
gift of bawling republicans, pauper peasants, desert towns,
trees of liberty, and the like, would be of no earthly use to
our Sovereign or her dominions. We can get as much from
the French people as ever we got from them, and can land
from steamers and barter for brandy, etc., without having
a Union Jack floating from Calais steeple.

" If it should appear to your Lordship that the country
you are visiting is likewise a foreign nation (and some
think that Lord Lyndhurst when he said as much never
said a truer word in his life), you will possibly calculate
the value of the province, and make your own reflections
regarding it. Could we buy corn or beasts, with Her Ma-
jesty's Irish Parliament sitting in College Green ? Would
we buy pigs out of a ship with a green flag at her stern ?
Do we want more from any man than leave to trade with
him fairly ? Suppose us administratively out of Ireland —
does anybody still advance that frantic assertion, viz.,
that some other nation would join with it ? Would any
nation want to take that place ? get any strength or good
out of it ? go partnership with that bankrupt ? If the
French wanted to invade us, it is not for want of men that
they don't do so. They have men enough. Boulogne is
nearer to England than Kingstown. But the world begins
to know the vulgar truth, that trading is better than fight-
ing, and that the plunder of all England would not be so
good as the leaving it alone. You might cook the British
goose and get one juicy meal from it ; but it is better to
let it lay eggs. This bugaboo of barbaric conspiracy surely
may be scouted nowadays. Nobody wants to invade us.
Only savages practise that kind of intercourse ; and why
speculate upon such projects on the part of our neighbors ?
Fie ! it is a want of confidence in an enlightened people,
and an intelligent and benevolent priesthood.

" I wish the Irishman every possible freedom and pros-
perity. I will give him sixpence with all the pleasure in
life ; but in exchange for a fair sixpennyworth of wheat,
pork, or butter. Last year I gave him money out of my
pocket, and was cursed for my pains. I will do so no more ;
never more. I prefer a quiet life, and have my own kin-

Isn't work scarce enough and life hard, but that every Eng-

stealthy priestly inquisition, what coarse cruelty and inso-

it seems to me as if the Irish virtues are, like their faults,
quite different to ours) have helped the degradation of this
fatal people, — what faults of our fathers or theirs have
produced this woful state, is not the question. But there it
is. There is your Irishman as you have made him under
English laws, English landlords, English juries, English
press, English Parliaments. His English landlord is beg-
gared ; he uses your English press as an incentive to rebel-
lion, and as a means of teaching the pike and vitriol exer-
cise ; he adulterates your English jury-box with perjury ; he
evades your English laws with lies, or combats them with
murder. Do you intend to alter our English institutions
for his benefit, or continue the non-governing him under our
own ? Are we to go on forever in our present condition, we
paying and grumbling, he cursing and starving ? Have any
laws, opinions, conquests, bargains of our forefathers a right
to bind us to this monstrous calamity ? As well say we
had no right to repeal the Test Acts or to change the repre-
sentation of the country. Fancy our system going on for-
ever as it now is. Fancy our persisting in governing Celts
by Saxon laws, and that horrible figure of Irish beggary
and ruin follows the march of our history into the future,
hangs on in piteous chains and rags, preventing our prog-
ress — it is frightful to look at. Ah, Sir, the Whigs are
enlightened statesmen, and Mr. Fox was a great man ; but
you who have got the Whig recipes and medicine-box, and
are Doctor-in-Chief of the three kingdoms, say, on your
honor and conscience, is there any drug, pill, or compound
which can set your Irish patient right ?

" Your Lordship's very humble Servant,

" HiBERNIS HiBERNIOR."



TO A NOBLEMAN VISITING IRELAND, 281



II.

The potato-crop being in a perilous condition, the Kevo-
lution adjourned, and the money to feed the people not
forthcoming, it is satisfactory to find that some Irish Kepeal
Members are disposed to put off political discussions for
the present ; and it is pleasant to listen to the Irish Clergy
raising up an affecting chorus of loyalty and devotion to
the Queen, of which everybody will appreciate the candor.

" The great point now is, to begin granting money as
quickly as possible, so as to enable our friends to carry on
the year comfortably. Your Lordship is pledged to this in
some manner ; and certain it is, that the Irish of all classes
are in need of that sort of relief. There's Tim has not
been able to earn anything in England this harvest, being
engaged in honor to stop at home and liberate his country
in the * War.' There's Pat has sunk all his capital in the
purchase of ^ a dainty rifle ; ' and though Thady has got his
commission as Lieutenant in the Brian-Boroo Body-guard,
yet pay-day hasn't come round, and it stands to reason that
he must be fed somehow. There's Father Tom has had no
fees, what with the bad times, and the War expenses of his
congregation ; there's the landlord has got in no rents ; and
he with bills out, mortgages to pay on, house and hounds to
keep, besides his four sons' hunters, the left wing of the
house to finish, and all the estate to drain. How can the
country get on without a loan ? and whose duty is it, but
that of Government, to come down with the money for
poor, suffering, bleeding, oppressed Ireland ?

" Go, and stay at Castle Crazy, and then say if this picture
of a countiy's desolation is overcharged. As you look on the
town through the beautiful cracked French windows of the
drawing-room, you will see the Park swarming with ragged
cloaks and frieze coats. You will see three or four old
crones squatted in the Hall porch, for whom the Masther
has a joke and, very rarely now, a sixpence ; as you go out
of the lodge-gate (which to be sure won't open unless they



282 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

come lift it), more will start out to let you pass through ;
and if you go with the Masther to look at the nags in the
stable, a score of tattered horseboys will be there to show
you the way. They will show you Masther Mick's gray
horse that ran for the Curragh Cup, or Masther Jack's bee
meer that ran second in the hurdle race, and Miss Biddy's
chestnut lilly, etc., etc. ; but all the people you see, from the
Masther down to poor half-witted Joe in the chimney-cor-
ner, with his feet in the turf, are in want of money, and
look to you quite naturally to supply it. Don't talk about
refusal. Are not the English gorged with Irish beef and
corn ? Who provides your pork, who wins your victories,
but the Irish ? If it is their right, they take it and thank
you for nothing ; if you refuse, you are tyrants and oppres-
sors. Those are to be the terms of the bargain ; at least
if words go for anything ; if Old Ireland and Young Ire-
land are to be believed ; and if O'Connell and Mitchel rep-
resent any opinions at all.

" And while you are arranging your plans for the relief
of this fine peasantry, which is now pretty quiet, being
about to ask you for money, you will remember that their
beautiful pikes, scythes, and dainty rifles (delicate instru-
ments, with which they proposed to reap tne present har-
vest) are all comfortably hidden away within call. I say it
behooves an English statesman to remember that Paddy has
a weapon somewhere at hand, with which he proposes to
' rise in the might of his freedom ' some day, or in other
words, to cut your throat. Where are all the lopped forests
of ash-poles which the patriots cut down before harvest,
and the bushels and cartloads of pikes which the black-
smiths flung off in such a heat and ardor of insurrection ?
The police, with all their vigilance, have not pounced on
twenty pounds worth of old iron, the people laugh in their
ragged sleeves, as they give them up, old muskets without
locks, and old rusty weapons, relics of former wars. The
pikes are only thrust away into the hedge or the bog ; and
so the animus to use them is merely laid aside convanient.

" I don't say this is particularly blameworthy on the part
of our Irish brethren. I don't say that they can do other-
wise — miserable as they are, and instructed as they have
been — but that you are bound to take account of it — and
to remember that the person whom you persist in keeping
in your house has been, from some cause or other, worked
up to a state of mad ferocity against you, and that he has a



TO A NOBLEMAN VISITING IRELAND, 283

knife concealed about his person somewhere, which he will
use on yours whenever he can attack you at an advantage.

" If this is the fact : if the people hates you, and you
have no means to pacify it, why should not the Irish gen-
tlemen try their hand to settle their own affairs in their
own city of Dublin ? How would their palavers hurt us ?
or how would our strength be injured by leaving them to
arrange their own difficulties, and provide for their own
poor ?

" And what if the orderly and sensible portion of the Irish
are at this minute actually prevented by you from keeping
order in their country ? — if the house is on fire and we
keep the keys of the engine ?

" Why, Sir, I say, are we to turn out and work the pump
for the Irish conflagration, and not allow them to put out
their own flames with their own buckets ? Why should n't
the Irish have a Council House or an Administrative As-
sembly of their own ? You never condescend to give rea-
sons or entertain the question. And yet there are only,
phrases against it. Mr. Canning says, * Kestore the Hep-
tarchy ! ' Mr. Macaulay says, ' Let the whole Empire go
down together, rather than a separation ensue.' Mr. Car-
lyle says, ' The British Lion will squelch the Irish Eat, but
separation must not be.' I hope to see a great party in
England before long, which shall say ^ Why not ? ' At any
rate, that it shall be a question open to fair debate ; and
that, when our Irish friends bawl out * Repeal,' some people
will answer * With all our hearts ! ' from this country, too.

" ' Gentlemen ' (that band of simple-minded patriots will
exclaim), * we get no good out of you. We pay you for your
pigs and oats, that you are always bragging about. As for
an army, it is not for love that you shoulder the musket,
but for money ; and to say that we are to keep a nation of
eight millions, in order that we may get forty or fifty thou-
sand men out of it, is as if you were to tell us to burn a
house down in order to roast a pig. We are tired of your
brawling, your bawling, your bullying, your bragging, your
begging. You stop our kindness with your curses, our pity
with your ludicrous menacing and boasting ; you render our
confidence impossible by your double-dealing. We may
part with you, and yet survive, without a restored Hep-
tarchy. We won't go down, even though we have the pleas-
ure of your company in the ship. As for " squelching," that
is out of the question. The British Lion has much better

occupation ; the business would fatigue him. The dog Billy
can do it infinitely better. We believe that we shall be
better without you than with your company ; and finally,
if you want Kepeal, we will do our utmost efforts not to
balk you.'

" Sentiments of this nature simply put forward, and con-
veyed to the leaders ecclesiastical and occult of the Irish
party, I believe would go farther to stop the Repeal move-
ments on the other side, than any efforts of conciliation ;
and I think we should begin to show that we are in earnest,
and to prepare our Irish friends for the change they look for.
by stopping the subsidies which they have been in the habit
of drawing from this country.

"Mighty Prince, and Reverend and Illustrious
Gentlemen ! — It has been universally allowed by most
nations, that Science would be vain if it did not tend to
produce happiness, and that that science is the greatest by
which the greatest amount of happiness is produced.

" I agree with the poet Solon in this remark — and if, as
I have no doubt, it is one which has also struck the august
intelligence of your Royal Highness — I beg to ask with
retiring modesty, what Science confers greater pleasure
than that which I have the honor to profess, and which
has made my name famous throughout the world ?

productive, his genius deteriorates, and his progeny dwin-
dles and sickens. A healthy digestion, on the other hand,
produces a healthy mind, a clear intellect, a vigorous fam-
ily, and a series of inestimable benefits to generations yet
unborn: and how can you have a good digestion, I ask,
without a good dinner ? and how have a good dinner, with-
out knowing how to cook it ?

" May it please your Royal Highness Consort of the Im-
perial Crown of England, and you ye learned and reverend
doctors, proctors, provosts, gyps, and common sizars of the
Eoyal University of Cambridge, now that you are wisely
resolved to enlarge the former narrow sphere of knowledge
in which your pupils move — I ask you at once, and with
unanimity, to ordain that MY Science be among the new
ones to be taught to the ingenuous youth of England.

" Mine is both a physical and moral science — physical,
it acts on the health ; moral, on the tempers and tastes of
mankind. Under one or other of these heads, then, it de-
serves to be taught in the famous Halls of Cambridge. I
demand and humbly request that the SOYEE PROFES-
SORSHIP of Culinarious Science be established without
loss of time. And I ask of your Imperial Highness and
the learned Heads of the University, what knowledge more
useful than that which I possess and profess could be con-
ferred upon a rising and ardent youth ?

" Who are the young men of Cambridge ? They are
brought up for the most part to the study of the Law or the
Church.

"Those who have partaken of food in the miserable
chambers of the law student, and seen their cadaverous ap-
pearance and unearthly voracity, will at once agree with me
that thej/ are in a lamentable state as regards eating. But
it is of the other profession which I speak.

" I can conceive now no person so likely to become emi-
nently useful and beloved as an interesting young ecclesias-
tic going down to take possession of his curacy in a distant
and barbarous province, where the inhabitants eat their
meat raw, their vegetables crude, and know no difference
between a white and a brown sauce, — I say, most noble,
mighty, and learned Sirs, I can conceive of no character
more delightful than a young curate coming into such a
district after having graduated honorably in MY Science.

home — see my Regenerator art, my kitchen at home — he
gives a model of neatness, propriety, and elegant modera-
tion. He goes from cottage to cottage, improving the diet
of the poor. He flavors the laborer's soup with simple
herbs, and roasts the stalled ox of the squire or farmer to
a turn. He makes tables comfortable which before were
sickening; families are united who once avoided each
other, or quarrelled when they met ; health returns, which
bad diet had banished from the cottager's home ; children
flourish and multiply, and as they crowd round the simple
but invigorating repast, bless the instructor who has taught
them to prepare their meal. Ah ! honored Prince, and ex-
alted gentlemen, what a picture do I draw of clerical influ-
ence and parochial harmony ! Talk of schools, indeed ! I
very much doubt whether a school-inspector could make a
souffle, or S. G. 0. of the Times could toss a pancake !

" And ah ! gentlemen, what a scene would the examina-
tion which I picture to myself present! The Professor
enters the Hall, preceded by his casserole bearers ; a hun-
dred furnaces are lighted ; a hundred elegant neophytes in
white caps are present behind them, exercising upon the
roasts, the stews, the vegetables, the sweets. A Board of
Examiners is assembled at a table spread with damask, and
the exercises of the young men are carried up to them hot
and hot. Who would not be proud to sit on such a Board,
and superintend the endeavors of youth engaged in such
labor ? Blushing, the Senior Medallist receives the Vice-
Chancellor's compliment, and is crowned with a fillet by
the Yeoman Bedell ; this — this I would fain behold in the
great, the enlightened, the generous, the liberal country of
my adoption !

" And if ever British gratitude should erect a statue to a
national benefactor, I can suppose an image of myself, the
First Professor of Cookery in Cambridge, to be elevated in
some conspicuous situation in after ages, holding out the
nectar which he discovered, and the sauce with which he
endowed the beloved country into which he came.

" Waiting your answer with respectful confidence, I am,
of your Royal Highness and Gentlemen,

DEATH OF THE EARL OF ROBINSON. 289



DEATH OF THE EAKL OF KOBINSOK
{In the manner of a popular Necrographer,)

1848.

IT is our duty to record this morning the demise of a no-
bleman who has for some time held a not insignificant
position in English politics and society. Augustus Gusta-
vus Adolphus Smith, Earl, Viscount and Baron Kobinson,
expired a quarter-of-an-hour ago at his house in Belgrave
Square, where indisposition has of late detained his Lord-
ship. His son, the Viscount Smith, at present third Earl
of Robinson, was immediately sent for from Paris, where
his Lordship is staying. The death of the second Earl will
no doubt be a shock to the present nobleman ; but as his
Lordship inherits Castle Robinson in Yorkshire, Robinson-
burgh, Mayo, the rich paternal estates in Norfolk and Suf-
folk, and the funded property, which is very considerable,
his grief will probably be of trifling duration.

The family of the Robinsons is rather numerous than
distinguished; nor can the biographer of the race dis-
cover that they were remarkable for talents or wit, or for
public or private virtue. The founder of the House was
known for many years by our ancestors as Cock Robinson,
and his juvenile escapades with Smith, and Brown, and
Jones, were long familiar subjects of public talk. Cock
Robinson was a creature of Walpole's, and accused — not
without justice, probably — of repeated malversations of
the public funds. He was Deputy of the Pewter Closet,
did not retire into private life without carrying with him
some of that metal over which he had the charge, and was
created a Baronet by a clever but certainly not squeamish
minister. This Sir Haycock Robinson died in 1764, and
was succeeded by his son Sir George Robinson.

Sir George represented Robinsontown in Parliament, and
increased the family estate, not by any genius or talent of
his own, but by an economy which was pushed perhaps



290 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS,

beyond the bounds of manliness ; and above all, by marry-
ing the immensely rich daughter of Wooley Brown, Esq.,
of Tobago. The absurdities of the lady, and the niggard-
liness of her husband, formed matter of fun for the wags
of the day; and cheese-paring Robinson and the whity-
brown heiress have had the honor of some satirical verses
from the pen of Topham Beauclerk. George III is said to
have been shocked when the Baroness Robinson was pre-
sented to Queen Charlotte at Court ; and cried out, " Black,
black; didn't know she was a black woman." However,
Robinson was a baron. The votes which he commanded,
and which were at the service of Lord North, Lord Rock-
ingham, the Lord Keeper Cecil, and indeed of every Minis-
try — and the lucky demise of the black heiress, raised
Baron Robinson to an Earldom ; at which period, though
stricken in years, he consoled himself by marrying a very
young lady — Arabella, daughter of Hicks, fifteenth Earl
of Blenkinsop, who subsequently ran away from his Lord-
ship.

The subject of the present memoir, Augustus Gustavus
Adolphus (then the Hon. G. A. A. Robinson), in the year 1799
entered the House of Commons, when Quiberoon capitulated.
Lord Nelson engaged the Spanish Armada, Mr. Huskisson
brought in his Turnpike Act, Mr. Tierney made his cele-
brated speech against the Pig-tail Tax, and the one-pound
note question was raising. On neither of these questions did
the new Peer think fit to speak from his place in the House
of Lords ; nor indeed did he open his lips there — a proof
of discretion on his Lordship's part, for nature had endowed
him with but a feeble brain, and he had the sense to be
aware of his utter mental inefficiency. It is a pity that, in
this respect, some of their Lordships would not take pat-
tern from the Earl of Robinson — a pity, too, that that
nobleman's own incapacity was such as to lead them justly
to mistrust him.

The young nobleman was educated — if it may be called
an education where a man can barely write his name (and
Lord Robinson could not be said to have gone much further
in the practice of orthographical learning) — at Eton, and
subsequently at Christchurch. It is needless to say that
he took an honorary degree. The Continent was as yet open
to our aristocratic youth, when the young man achieved
the distinction just mentioned, and the young Peer took
the grand tour of Europe. A quarto volume was published,



DEATH OF THE EARL OF ROBINSON. 291

with some observations on Hecla and Stromboli, by Vis-
count Smith ; but it was known that the work was written
by the Keverend Baring Leader, his tutor, and afterwards
Bishop of Bullocksmithy — a man neither conspicuous for
preaching nor practice, and who might be called, by the
severe, a disgrace to the Church.

In person. Lord Robinson was corpulent rather than
athletic, and ungainly without being strong. He was marked
with the smallpox in infancy, and by that disease deprived
of an eye. His lameness was the result of a subsequent
accident. His Lordship lisped and could not pronounce the
letter R. Mr. Canning^s lines about "Woninthon" will
probably be remembered by our readers. They are to be
found in that clever but overrated Miscellany, the Anti-
jacobin.

He was sent to negotiate the Treaty of Straalsund, when
the capitulation of Magdeburg gave some hopes to the
Allies (though it may be supposed that a person such as
Lord Robinson was merely a ceremony, and that the work
was really done by subordinates); but the negotiations,
whatever they may have been, were interrupted by the
best reason in the world — Mack's victory. The battle of
Pultowa, Count Tilly's brilliant engagement with Mirola-
dovich, and the sudden burst of Napoleon into the Ukraine
and Swedish Pomerania with an army of five hundred thou-
sand French, Poles, and Italians of the Old Guard, abruptly
ended the conference, and sent the diplomatists to the right
about. Lord Robinson narrowly escaped capture in the
frigate " Arethusa," which brought him from his mission.
She was chased and engaged by the French ship "Belle
Poule," in the Bay of Bengal, and the particulars of the
action are narrated in James. His Lordship was not com-
plimented for his courage in the affair — but he was a civil-
ian and suffered greatly from seasickness.

In 1811 his Lordship married Blanchefleur, the beautiful
daughter of Harquebuss, Duke of Fitzbattleaxe. Gillray's
caricatures of the pair are still to be seen in the portfolios
of collectors. SuflB.ce it to say, their union was not a happy
one.

The pleasures of the table appear in late years to have
been Lord Robinson's only passion. His dinners were the
most splendid given in this city, and were frequented by
those who contributed their wit in return for his entries.
His Lordship's mind did not enable him to appreciate the



292 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

former, and it is owing to a too great indulgence in tlie
latter that he has been called away from a world which will
not very much miss him.

With all his splendor Lord Eobinson was said to be
stingy, and, though dull, he was not good-natured, as are
some stupid people. His deafness of late years still farther
excluded him from the enjoyment of society. But beyond
these points little can be said in his dispraise. So long as
his tenants paid their rents, he did not annoy them. He
cannot be said to have cheated his tradesmen, — to have
picked a pocket, or to have robbed a church ; nor, on the
other hand, can it be stated of him that he invented gun-
powder or set the Thames on fire.

THE GREAT SQUATTLEBOROUGH SOIR^.

GOD MR. PUNCH,
— I am an author
by trade, and in con-
fidence send you my
card, whicli will sat-
isfy you of my name
and my place of
business. If the de-
signer of the series
of cuts called "Au-
thors' Miseries " *
will take my case in
hand, I will not ask
to plead it myself ;
otherwise, as it is
one which concerns
most literary per-
sons, and as the an-
noyance of which I
complain may be a
source of serious loss
and evil to them, I
take leave to cry
out on behalf of our craft.

The system of oppression gainst which I desire to pro-
test is one which has of late been exercised by vanous
bodies, in various parts of the kingdom — by the harmless,
nay, most laudable Literary Societies there established.
These, under the name of AthenEeums, Institutes, Parthe-
nons, and what not, meet together for the purposes of lit-
erary exercitation ; have reading-rooms supplied with mag-
azines, books, newspapers, and your own invaluable mis-
cellany i and lecture-rooms, where orators, and philosophers,

and men of science appear to instruct or to amuse. The
Sea Serpent, the character of Hamlet, the royal orrery and
dissolving views, the female characters in Mrs. Jones's
novels, etc. — whatever may be the subject of the lecturer
— I am sure no friend to his kind would wish either to
prevent that honest man from getting his bread, or his au-
dience from listening to his harangues. Lecturers are not
always consummately wise, but that is no reason why au-
diences should not listen to them. Myself, Sir, as I walked
down Holborn the other day, I saw placarded ^amongst
other names far more illustrious) my own name, in pretty
much the following terms : —

"L. A. HUGGLESTONE.

" ARE THE WRITINGS OF HUGGLESTONE MORAL OR IMMORAL ?

" Professor Groutage will deliver an Essay on this subject, on the 25th
instant, at the Philosophical Arena and Psychogymnasium, Cow Lane,
Smithfield. After the Lecture, the Arena will be opened for free discus-
sion. Admission 2d.j Children Id."

I, of course, did not attend, but female curiosity induced
Mrs. Hugglestone to pay her money. She returned home,
Sir, dissatisfied. I am informed the Professor did not do
me justice. My writings are not appreciated by Mr. Grout-
age (nor indeed by many other critics), and my poor Louisa,
who had taken our little James, who is at home for the
Christmas holidays, by way of treat, came home with mor-
tification in her heart that our Jemmy should have heard
his father so slightingly spoken of by Groutage, and said,
with tears in her own eyes, that she should like to scratch
out those of the philosopher in question.

Because the Professor has but a mean opinion of me, is
that any reason why free discussion should not be per-
mitted ? Far otherwise. As Indians make fire with bits
of wood, blockheads may strike out sparks of truth in the
trituration of debate, and I have little doubt that had my
poor dear girl but waited for the discussion in the arena,
my works would have had their due, and Groutage got his
answer. The people may be lectured to by very stupid
quacks (perhaps, Sir, it may have been your fortune to have
heard one or two of them) ; but, as sure as they are quacks,
so sure will they be discovered one day or other, and T, for
my part, do not care a fig for the opinion of the Professor



THE GREAT SQUATTLEBOROUGH SOIREE. 295

of Cow Lane. I am putting merely my own ease in illus-
tration of the proposition, which is, that public debates and
fair play of thought among men are good, and to be en-
couraged. Those who like to read better out of a book
than to listen to a long-haired lecturer, with his collars
turned down (so that his jaws may wag more freely), those
who prefer a pipe at the neighboring tavern to a debate,
however stirring, at the Cow Lane Gymnasium, are welcome
and right, but so are the others on the other side.

I will mention a case which seems to me in point. In my
early days, my friend Huffy, the dentist, with myself and
several others, belonged to the Plato Club, meeting of
Saturday nights in Covent Garden, to discuss the writings
of that philosopher, and to have a plain supper and a
smoke. I and some others used to attend pretty regularly,
but only at the smoking and supping part, which caused
Huffy to say, with a look of considerable scorn, " that there
were some minds not capable of sustaining or relishing a
philosophical investigation.'^ The fact was, we were not
anxious to hear Huffy's opinions about Plato at all, and
preferred scalloped oysters to that controversy.

I submit that, in this case, both parties were right, —
— Huffy in indulging himself in Platonic theories, and we
for refraining from them. We doubted our lecturer — of
our scalloped oysters we were sure. We were only sceptics
in this instance, not in all ; and so in the multifarious In-
stitutes throughout the country, where speechifying is per-
formed, I own I sometimes have doubts as to the whole-
someness of the practice. But it is certain that if there
may be stupid lectures, there may be clever lectures ; there
may be quacks or men of genius ; there may be knowledge
good and sound acquired ; there may be but a superficial
smattering and parrot-like imitation of a teacher who him-
self is but a pretender ; and it is clear also that people
should talk, should think, should read, should have tea in
a social manner, and, calling the fiddlers and their wives
and daughters, have a dance together at the Parthenon,
Athenaeum, or Institute, until they are tired, and go home
happy. And if in a manufacturing town, of course it is
good that the master of the mill should join in the sport in
which his hands are engaged ; or in the country districts,
that the great man or Squire should aid. For example, I
read last year in the Squattlehorough Sentinel, how the heir
of the noble house of Yawny, the Honorable Mr. Draw-

leigh, caoue over ten miles to Squattleborough in the most
slushy weather, and delivered four lectures there on his
travels in Nineveh, and his measurements of the tombs of
Baalbec. Some people fell asleep at these lectures, no
doubt, but many liked them, and Mr. Drawleigh was right
to give them.

He represents the borough. His family are time out of
mind lords of the neighborhood. Nothing is more cer-
tain than that the heir of Dozeley Castle should do his
utmost to give pleasure to his faithful constituents and the
children of the quondam retainers of his race. It was he
who set up the Squattleborough Parthenon, his father. Lord
Yawny, laying the first brick of the edifice ; the neighbor-
ing clergy and gentry attending and delivering appropriate
orations, and the library beginning with two copies of
Drawleigh's own Travels, in morocco gilt. This is all
right. But the Squattleborough Parthenon is not, for this,
" the Beacon of Truth, the Centre of Civilization, the Pharos
in the Storm which the troubled voyager sees from the dark
waters, radiating serenely with the Truthful and the Beauti-
ful,'^ as Professor Jowls said at the Inauguration Meeting,
— the Squattleborough Institution, I say, is not in the least
like this, but an excellent good place enough, where every
man can read the paper, if it is not in hand ; or get a book
from the library, if nobody else has engaged it. Let things
be called by their names, Mr. Punch ; this place at Squattle-
borough is a good literary club, and that is a good thing,
and it promotes the good fellowship, and aids the reading
and education of numbers of people there; and Heaven
send every such scheme prosperity !

But now the Squattleborough folks are bent on following
the fashion, and having a grand tea-party at their Institute.
Amongst others, I have been favored with a card to this
party. The secretary writes in the kindest manner; he
says the directors of the Institute are going to give a grand
soiree J which many noblemen and gentlemen of the neigh-
borhood have promised to attend, and where they are most
anxious " to secure the leading literary talent."

Noblemen and Gentlemen of the neighborhood, a la bonne
heure — and it is very complimentary, doubtless, to be men-
tioned amongst the leading literary talent ; a noble lord, a
couple of most reverend prelates, a great poet, and so forth,
we are informed, are asked. But why the deuce does
Squattleborough want "to secure literary talent " ? Gentle-

men, do you think men of letters have nothing to do ? Do
you go three hundred miles to a tea-party, spend five or six
pounds on railroads and inns, give up two days' work and
a night's sleep, at the request of people hundreds of miles
away, of whom you have no earthly knowledge ? There are
one or two men of letters who, upon a great occasion, and
by a great city, are rightly called to help and to speak ;
these men are great orators, — whom it is a privilege for
any community to hear, — but for those whose gift does not
lie that way,. why drag them out from their homes, or their
own friends, or their desks, where their right places are ?

I, for instance, who write this, have had a dozen invita-
tions within the last few months. I should have had to
travel many thousands of miles — to spend ever so many
scores of pounds — to lose weeks upon weeks of time —
and for what ? In order to stand on a platform, at this
town or that, to be pointed out as the author of So-and-so,
and to hear Lord This, or the Archbishop of That, say that
Knowledge was Power, that Education was a benefit, that
the free and enlightened people of What-d'ye-call-'em were
daily advancing in Civilization, and that the learning of the
ingenuous arts, as the Latin bard had observed, refined our
manners, and mitigated their ferocity.

Advance, civilize, cease to be ferocious, read, meet, be
friendly, be happy, ye men of Squattleborough, and other
places. I say amen to all this ; but if you can read for
yourselves it is the best. If you can be wise without brag-
ging and talking so much about it, you will lose none of
your wisdom ; and as you and your wives and daughters
will do the dancing at your own ball, if you must have a
talk likewise, why not get your native lions to roar ?
Yours, dear Mr. Punch, most respectfully,

Leontius Andbogles Hugglestone.

PAKIS REVISITED.



EVERED PUNCH,—
When your multitudi-
nous readers are put in
possession of this confi-
de ntiaJ note, Paris will
be a week older ; and
who knows what may
happen in that time ? —
Louis Napoleon may be
Emperor, or Louis Blanc
may be King, or the Rev-
olution that was to have
broken out last Monday
may be perfonned on the
next; — meanwhile, per-
mit me, Sir, to lay at
your feet the few brief
observations which I have
made durii^ a twenty-
lour hours' residence m
this ancient and once jo-
vial place.

It was on the stroke of
eleven at night, Sir, on
Wednesday, the 31st of
January, that a traveller
might have been per-
ceived plunging rap dly through the shingles of Dover,
towards a boat which lay n wa t ng there, to bear him and
other exilea to a steamer wh cb laj in the of&ng, her slim
black hull scarcely visible m the mists of night, through
which her lights, of a green and ruby color, burned bril-

liantly. The moon was looking out on the fair and tranquil
scene, the stars were twinkling in a friendly manner, the
ancient cliffs of Albion loomed out of the distant gray.
But few lights twinkled in the deserted houses of the ter-
races along the beach. The bathing-machines were gone to
roost. There was scarce a ripple on the sluggish wave, as
the boat with The Traveller on board went grinding over
the shingle, and we pulled to the ship. In fact, the waters
of Putney were not more calm than those of the Channel,
and the night was as mild as a novel by the last lady of
fashion.

Having paid a shilling for the accommodation of the boat,
the traveller stepped on board the deck of the famous
steamer "Vivid," commanded by the intrepid and polite
Captain Smithett; and the Mails presently coming off in
their boat with the light at its bows, away went the
" Vivid " at the rate of seventeen miles an hour, and we
were off Calais almost before the second cigar was smoked,
or we had had near time enough to think of those beloved
beings whom we left behind.

Sir, there was not water enough in the Calais harbor —
so a bawling pilot swore, who came up to us in his lugger :
and as she came plunging and bumping against the side of
the "Vivid,'' Captain Smithett caused the mail-bags first,
and afterwards the passengers, to be pitched into her, and
we all rolled about amongst the ropes and spars on deck, in
the midst of the most infernal bawling and yelling from
the crew of Frenchmen, whose howls and contortions, as
they got their sail up, and otherwise manoeuvred the ves-
sel, could be equalled by men of no other nation. Some of
us were indignant at being called upon to pay three francs
for a ride of a mile in this vessel, and declared we would
write to the Times ; but there was One Traveller who had
not heard that noise of Frenchmen for four years, and their
noise was to his soul as the music of bygone years. That
Man, Sir, is perpetually finding something ludicrous in what
is melancholy, and when he is most miserable is always
most especially jocular.

Sir, it was the first night of the new Postal arrangement,
by which the Mails are made to go from Calais and not
from Boulogne, as heretofore. Our goods were whisked
through the Custom House with a rapidity and a courtesy
highly creditable to Frenchmen, and an enthusiastic omni-
bus-driver, lashing his horses furiously, and urging them

forward with shrieks and howls, brought us to the Saint
Pierre Station of the railway, where we took our places in
the train. 'Twas two in the bleak winter's mom. The en-
gine whistled — the train set forth — we plunged into the
country, away, away, away !

At eleven o'clock, Sir, we dashed into the enceinte of the
forts that guard the metropolis from foreign invasion, and
a few minutes afterwards we were in that dear old Paris
that One amongst us had not seen for four years.

How is the old place ? How does it look ? I should be
glad to know is the nightingale singing there yet ? — do the
roses still bloom by the calm Bendemeer ? Have we not
all a right to be sentimental when we revisit the haunts
of our youth, and to come forward, like the Count in the
Opera, as soon as the whips have ceased cracking, and sing
" Cari luoghi " ? Living constantly with your children and
the beloved and respectable Mrs. Punch, you don't see how
tall Jacky and Tommy grow, and how old — (for the truth
must out, and she is by no means improved in looks) — how
old and plain your dear lady has become. So thought I, as
I once more caught sight of my beloved Lutetia, and trem-
bled to see whether years had affected her.

Sir, the first thing I saw on entering the station was that
it was crammed with soldiers — little soldiers, with red
breeches and gray capotes, with little caps, bristling with
uncommonly fierce beards, large hairy tufts (those of the
carroty hue most warlike and remarkable) that looked as if
worn in bravado, as by the American warriors, and growing
there convenient to cut their heads off if you could. These
bearded ones occupied the whole place ; arms were piled in
the great halls of the D^barcadere ; some fatigued braves
were asleep in the straw, pots were cooking, drums were
drubbing, officers and non-commissioned officers bustling
about. Some of us had qualms, and faintly asked was the
Revolution begun? "No," the omnibus conductors said,
laughing, " everything was as quiet as might be : " and we
got into their vehicles and drove away. Everything was
quiet. Only, Sir, when you go to a friend's house for a quiet
dinner, and before he lets you into his door he puts his
head and a blunderbuss out of window and asks " Who is
there ? " — of course some nervous persons may be excused
for feeling a little dashed.

Sir, the omnibus drove rapidly to the hotel whence this
is written, with a very scanty cargo of passengers. We



PARIS REVISITED. 301

hardly had any in the railway ; we did not seem to take up
any on the line. Nothing seemed to be moving on the
road ; in the streets there was not much more life. What
has become of the people who used to walk here ? — of the
stalls and the carts and the crowds about the wine-shops,
and the loungers, and the cries of the busy throng ? Some-
thing has stricken the place. Nobody is about: or per-
haps there is a review, or a grand fete somewhere, which
calls the people away as we are passing through a deserted
quarter.

As soon as I was dressed, I walked into the town through
the ancient and familiar arcades of the Rue Castiglione and
so forth. The shops along the Rue de Rivoli are dreary
and shabby beyond belief. There was nobody walking in
the Tuilleries. The palace that used to look so splendid in
former days, stretches out its great gaunt wings and looks
dismally battered and bankrupt. In the Carrousel there
were more troops, with drumming, and trumpeting, and ar-
tillery. Troops are perpetually passing. Just now I saw
part of a regiment of Mobiles marching out with a regiment
of the line. Squads of the young Mobiles are everywhere
in the streets : pale, debauched, daring-looking little lads,
one looks at them with curiosity and interest, as one thinks
that those beardless young fellows have dashed over bar-
ricades, and do not care for death or devil.

I worked my way to the Palais Royal, where I have been

any time since 1814 ; and oh, Mr. Punch, what a change

was there ! I can't tell you how dreary it looks, that once

cheerfullest garden in the world. The roses do not bloom

there any more, or the nightingales sing. All the song is

gone, and the flowers have withered. Sir, you recollect

those shops where the beautiful dressing-gowns used to

hang out, more splendid and gorgeous than any tulips, I

am sure. You remember that wonderful bonnet-shop at

the corner of the Galerie Vitr^e, where there were all sorts

of miraculous caps and hats ; bonnets with the loveliest

wreaths of spring twined round them ; bonnets with the

most ravishing plumes of marabouts, ostriches, and birds of

paradise —

*' Once in their hows
Birds of rare plnme
Sate in their bloom/'

as an elegant poet of your own sings — they are all gone. Sir ;
the birds are flown, the very cages are shut up and many of

them to let — the Palais Koyal is no more than a shabby
bazaar. Shutters are up in many of the shops — you see
nobody buying in the others — soldiers and a few passen-
gers go about staring at the faded ornaments in the win-
dows and the great blank daguerreotype pictures, which
line the walls as dismal as death. There is nobody there :
there are not even English people walking about, and star-
ing, with their hands in their pockets. Has ruin begun,
then, and is Paris going after Kome, Carthage, Palmyra,
Kussell Square, Kilkenny, and other famous capitals ? In
the glass galleries there were not a dozen loungers, and the
shops facing the Palais Koyal proper are closed down the
whole line.

As for the square of the palace itself, which always used
to look so cheerful — where there used to be, you remem-
ber, piles of comfortable wood, giving ideas of warmth and
hospitality in the splendid rooms within — that too is, to
the last degree, shabby and forlorn. I saw soldiers looking
out of the windows, and more — a couple of thousands of
them, I should say — were in the court. Many of them with
their coats off, and showing very dingy under-vestments,
were cooking about the court ; there they formed in squads
about the square, without their arms, in their slouching
gray coats; and, drums and bugles beginning to make a
noise, a small crowd of blackguards and children issued
somehow from some of the dark recesses and black pas-
sages about the place, and formed a sort of audience for the
unromantic military spectacle. A tree of Liberty is planted
in the square ; the first I have seen, and the most dismal
and beggarly emblem I ever set eyes on. A lean poplar,
with scarce any branches, a wretched furcated pole with
some miserable rags of faded cotton, and, it may be, other
fetiches dangling from it here and there. O Liberty !
What the deuce has this poplar or those rags to do with
you?

My sheet is full — the post-hour nigh ; but I have one
word of rather a cheerful and consolatory nature to say
after all this despondency. Sir, I happened in my walk,
and from a sense of duty, just to look in at the windows of
Chevet, V^four, and the Trois Freres. The show at all is
very satisfactory indeed. The game looked very handsome
at Chevet's, and the turbots and pates uncommonly fine.
I never saw finer looking truffles than those in the baskets
in V^f our's window ; and the display of fruit at the Freres

TWO OR THREE THEATRES AT PARIS.

1849.

F one may read the history of a people's
morals in its jokes, what a queer set of re-
flections the philosophers of the twentieth
century may make i-egarding the characters
of our two centuries in perusing the wag-
geries published on one side and the other !
When the future inquirer shall take up
your volumes, or a bundle of French plays,
and contrast the performance of your booth
with that of the Parisian theatre, he won't
fail to remark how different they are, and what different
objects we admire or satirize. As for your morality, Sir,
it does not become me to compliment you on it before your
venerable face ; but permit me to say, that there never were
before published in this world so many volumes that con-
tained so much cause for laughing, and so little for blush-
ing ; so many jokes, and so little barm. Why, Sir, say even
that your modesty, which astonishes me more and more
every time I regard you, is calculated, and not a virtue nat-
urally inherent in you, that very fact would argue for the '
high sense of the public morality among us. We will laugh
in the company of our wives and children ; we will tolerate
no iudecorum : we like that our matrons and girls should
be pure.

Excuse my blushes. Sir ; but permit me to say that I
have been making a rouud of the little French theatres, and
have come away amazed at the cynicism of the people.
Sir, there are certain laws of morality (as believed by us at
least) for which these people no more care than so many
Otaheitans. They have been joking against marrit^e ever
since writing began — a pretty man you would be, Mr.
PuKCH, if you were a Frenchman ; and a pretty moral
character would be the preaeut spotless wife of your affec-
tions, the chaate and immaculate Judy !



TWO OR THREE THEATRES AT PARIS, 305

After going to these theatres, seeing the houses all full,
and hearing the laughter ringing through every one of
them, one is puzzled to know what the people respect at all,
or what principle they do believe in. They laugh at reli-
gion, they laugh at chastity, they laugh at royalty, they
laugh at the Eepublic most pitilessly of all ; when France,
in the piece called the " Foire aux Idees," says she is dying
under nine hundred doctors, to each of whom she is paying
a daily fee of five-and-twenty francs, there was a cheer of
derision through the house. The Communists and their
schemes were hooted with a still more hearty indignation ;
there is a general smash and bankruptcy of faith ; and, what
struck me perhaps most as an instance of the amazing pro-
gress of the national atheism, is to find that the theatre
audiences have even got to laugh at military glory. They
have a song in one of the little plays, which announces that
France and Co. have closed that branch of their business ;
that they wish to stay at home and be quiet, and so forth ;
and, strange to say, even the cry against perfidious England
has died out ; and the only word of abuse I read against
our nation was in a volume of a novel by poor old Paul de
Kock, who saluted the Lion with a little kick of his harm-
less old heels.

Is the end of time coming, Mr. Punch, or the end of
Frenchmen ? and don't they believe, or love, or hate any-
thing any more ? Sir, these funny pieces at the plays
frightened me more than the most bloodthirsty melodrama
ever did, and inspired your humble servant with a melan-
choly which is not to be elicited from the most profound
tragedies. There was something awful, infernal almost, I
was going to say, in the gayety with which the personages
of these satiric dramas were dancing and shrieking about
among the tumbled ruins of ever so many ages and tradi-
tions. I hope we shall never have the air of " God save
the King " set to ribald words amongst us — the mysteries
of our religion, or any man's religion, made the subject of
laughter, or of a worse sort of excitement. In the famous
piece of " La Propri^t^ c'est le Vol," we had the honor to
see Adam and Eve dance a polka, and sing a song quite
appropriate to the costume in which they figured. Every-
body laughed and enjoyed it — neither Eve nor the audi-
ence ever thought about being ashamed of themselves ; and,
for my part, I looked with a vague anxiety up at the theatre
roof, to see that it was not falling in, and shall not be

surprised to hear that Paris goes the way of certain other
cities some day. They will go on, this pretty little painted
population of lorettes and bayaderes, singing and dancing,
laughing and feasting, fiddling and flirting, to the end, de-
pend upon it. But enough of this theme : it is growing too
serious — let us drop the curtain. Sir, at the end of the
lively and ingenious piece called the "Foire aux Id^es,"
there descends a curtain, on which what is supposed to be
a huge newspaper is painted, and which is a marvel of cyni-
cism.

I have been to see a piece of a piece called the " Mysteres
de Londres," and most awful mysteries they are indeed.
We little know what is going on around and below us, and
that London may be enveloped in a vast murderous conspir-
acy, and that there may be a volcano under our very kitch-
ens, which may blow us all to perdition any day. You per-
haps are not aware, Sir, that there lived in London, some
three or four years ago, a young Grandee of Spain and
Count of the Empire, the Marquis of Eio Santo by name,
who was received in the greatest society our country can
boast of, and walked the streets of the metropolis with or-
ders on his coat and white light pantaloons and a cocked-
hat. This Marquis was an Irishman by birth, and not a
mere idle votary of pleasure, as you would suppose from his
elegant personal appearance. Under the mask of fashion
and levity he hid a mighty design ; which was to free his
country from the intolerable tyranny of England. And as
England's distress is Ireland's opportunity, the Marquis had
imagined a vast conspiracy, which should plunge the for-
mer into the most exquisite confusion and misery, in the
midst of which his beloved Erin might get her own. For
this end his lordship had organized a prodigious band of all
the rogues, thieves, and discontented persons in the metropo-
lis, who were sworn into a mysterious affiliation, the mem-
bers of which were called the " Gentlemen of the Night."
Nor were these gentlefolks of the lower sort merely — your
swell mob, your Saint Giles's men, and vulgar cracksmen.
Many of the principal merchants, jewellers, lawyers, phy-
sicians, were sworn of the Society. The merchants forged
bank-notes, and uttered the same, thus poisoning the stream
of commerce in our great commercial city ; the jewellers
sold sham diamonds to the aristocracy, and led them on to
ruin ; the physicians called in to visit their patients, poi-
soned such as were enemies of the good cause, by their art-



TWO OR THREE THEATRES AT PARIS, 807

ful prescriptions; the lawyers prevented the former from
being hanged ; and the whole realm being plunged into anar-
chy and dismay by these manoeuvres, it was evident that
Ireland would greatly profit. This astonishing Marquis,
who was supreme chief of the Society, thus had his spies
and retainers everywhere. The police was corrupted, the
magistrature tampered with — Themis was bribed on her
very bench; and even the Beefeaters of the Queen (one
shudders as one thinks of this) were contaminated, and in
the service of the Association.

Numbers of lovely women of course were in love with
the Marquis, or otherwise subjugated by him, and the most
beautiful and innocent of all was disguised as a Countess,
and sent to Court on a Drawing-room day, with a mission to
steal the diamonds off the neck of Lady Brompton, the spe-
cial favorite of his Grace Prince Dimitri Tolstoy, the Rus-
sian Ambassador.

Sir, his Grace the Russian Ambassador had only lent
these diamonds to Lady B., that her ladyship might sport
them at the Drawing-room. The jewels were really the
property of the Prince's Imperial Master. What, then,
must have been his Excellency's rage when the brilliants
were stolen ! The theft was committed in the most artful
manner. Lady Brompton came to Court, her train held up
by her jockei, Suzanna (the Marquis's emissary) came to
Court with her train similarly borne by her page. The
latter was an experienced pickpocket; the pages were
changed ; the jewels were taken off Lady Brompton's neck
in the antechamber of the palace; and his Grace Prince
Tolstoy was in such a rage that he menaced war on the part
of his Government unless the stones were returned !

Beyond this point I confess, Sir, I did not go, for ex-
hausted nature would bear no more of the Mysteries of
London, and I came away to my hotel. But I wish you
could have seen the Court of Saint James, the Beefeaters,
the Life-Guards, the Heralds-of-Arms in their tabards of
the sixteenth century, and have heard the ushers on the
stairs shouting the names of the nobility as they walked
into the presence of the Sovereign ! I caught those of the

ated prelates, with the exception of the wig, which was far
more curly and elegant ; and he walked by, making the sign
of the Cross with his two forefingers, and blessing the
people.

I hear that the author of this great work. Monsieur Paul
Feval, known for some time to the literature of his coun-
try as Sir Francis TroUope, passed a whole week in Lon-
don to make himself thoroughly acquainted with our man-
ners ; and here, no doubt, he saw Countesses whose trains
were carried by jockeys; Lords going to Court in full-
bottomed wigs ; and police magistrates in policemen's coats
and oilskin hats, with white kerseymere breeches and silk
stockings to distinguish them from the rank and file. How
well the gentlemen of Bow Street would look in it! I
recommend it to the notice of Mr. Punch.

These, Sir, are all the plays which I have as yet been
able to see in this town, and I have the honor of reporting
upon them accordingly. Whatever they may do with other
pieces, I don't think that our dramatists will be disposed to
steal these.



ON SOME DINNERS AT PARIS.




ON SOME DINNERS AT PARIS.

1849.

OME few words about dinners,
my dear friend, I know your
benevolent mind will expect.
man who comes to Paris
without directing his mind to
dinners, is like a fellow who
I travels to Athens without car-
1 ing to inspect ruina, or an indi-
vidual who goes to the Opera,
and misBes Jenny Lind'a sing-
ing. No, I should be ungrate-
ful to that appetite with which
Nature has bountifully en-
dowed me — to those recollec-
tions which render a considerar
tion of the past so exquisite an enjoyment to me — were
I to think of coming to Paris without enjoying a few quiet
evenings at the Trois Frerea, alone, with a few dishes,
a faithful waiter who knows me of old, and my own
thoughts ; undisturbed by conversation, or having to help
the soup or carve the turkey for the lady of the house ; by
the exertion of telling jokes for the entertainment of the
company : by the ennui of a stupid neighbor at your side,
to wnom you are forced to impart them ; by the disgust of
hearing an opposition wag talk better than yourself, take
the stories with which you have come primed and loaded
out of your very mouth, and fire them off himself, or auda-
ciously bring forward old Joe Millers, and get a laugh from
all the company, when your own novelties and neatest
impromptus and inots pass round the table utterly disre-
garded.

I rejoiced, Sir, in my mind, to think that I ahould be able
to dine alone ; without rivals to talk me out, hosts or ladies
to coax and wheedle, or neighbors who, before my eyes (as



310 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS,

they often have done), will take the best cutlet or favorite
snipe out of the dish, as it is handed round, or to whom
you have to give all the breast of the pheasant or capon,
when you carve it.

All the way in the railroad, and through the tedious
hours of night, I whiled away such time as I did not employ
in sleeping, or in thinking about Miss Br-wn (who felt, I
think, by the way, some little pang in parting with me,
else why was she so silent all night, and why did she apply
her pocket-handkerchief so constantly to her lovely ame-
thyst eyes ?) — all the way in the railroad, I say, when not
occupied by other thoughts, I amused the tedium of the
journey by inventing little bills of fare for one, — solitary
Barmecide banquets, — which I enjoyed in spirit, and pro-
posed to discuss bodily on my arrival in the Capital of the
Kitchen.

" Monsieur will dine at the tahle-d'htte ? " the laquais de
place said at the hotel, whilst I was arranging my elegant
toilette before stepping forth to renew an acquaintance with
our beloved old city. An expression of scornful incredulity
shot across the fine features of the person addressed by the
laquais de place. My fine fellow, thought I, do you think
I am come to Paris in order to dine at a tahle^^Mte ? —
to meet twenty-four doubtful English and Americans at an
ordinary ? " LucuUus dines with Lucullus to-day, sir ; "
which, as the laquais de place did not understand, I added,
" I never dine at table-d^hdte, except at an extremity."

I had arranged in my mind a little quiet week of dinners.
Twice or thrice, thinks I, I will dine at the Frbres, once at
Vary's, once at the Caf^ de Paris. If my old friend Voisin
opposite the Assomption has some of the same sort of Bor-
deaux which we recollect in 1844, I will dine there at least
twice. Philippe's, in the Kue Montorgueil, must be tried,
which, they say, is as good as the Eocher de Cancale used
to be in our time : and the seven days were chalked out
already, and I saw there was nothing for it but to breakfast
d la fourchette at some of the other places which I had in
my mind, if I wished to revisit all my old haunts.

To a man living much in the world, or surrounded by his
family, there is nothing so good as this solitude from time
to time — there is nothing like communing with your own
heart, and giving a calm and deliberate judgment upon
the great question — the truly vital question, I may say —
before you. What is the use of having your children, who



ON SOME DINNERS AT PARIS, 811

live on roast mutton in the nursery, and think treacle-pud-
ding the summit of cookery, to sit down and take the best
three fourths of a perdreau truffe with you ? What is the
use of helping your wife, who doesn't know the difference
between sherry and madeira, to a glass of priceless Ro-
mance or sweetly odoriferous Chateau Lafitte of '42 ? Poor
dear soul ! she would be as happy with a slice of the chil-
dren's joint, and a cup of tea in the evening. She takes
them when you are away. To give fine wine to that dear
creature is like giving pearls to — to animals who don't
know their value.

What I like, is to sit at a restaurant alone, after having
taken a glass of absinthe in water, about half-an-hour pre-
vious, to muse well over the carte, and pick out some little
dinner for myself ; to converse with the sommelier confi-
dentially about the wine — a pint of Champagne, say, and
a bottle of Bordeaux, or a bottle of Burgundy, not more,
for your private drinking. He goes out to satisfy your
wishes, and returns with the favorite flask in a cradle, very
likely. Whilst he is gone, comes old Antoine — who is
charmed to see Monsieur de retour ; and vows that you
rajeunissez tons les ans — with a plate of oysters — dear
little juicy green oysters in their upper shells, swimming
in their sweet native brine — not like your great white
flaccid natives in England, that look as if they had been
fed on pork : and ah ! how kindly and pretty that attention
is of the two little plates of radishes and butter, which they
bring you in, and with which you can dally between the
arrival of the various dishes of your dinner ; they are like
the delicate symphonies which are played at the theatre
between the acts of a charming comedy. A little bread and
butter, a little radish — you crunch and relish ; a little
radish, a little piece of bread and butter — you relish and
crunch — when lo ! up goes the curtain, and Antoine comes
in with the entree or the roast.

I pictured all this in my mind and went out. I will not
tell any of my friends that I am here, thought I. Sir, in
five minutes, and before I had crossed the Place VendSme,
I had met five old acquaintances and friends, and in an
hour afterwards the arrival of your humble servant was
known to all our old set.

My first visit was for Tom Dash, with whom I had busi-
ness. That friend of my youth received* me with the
utmost cordiality : and our business transacted and our

acquaintances talked over (four of them I had seen, so that
it was absolutely necessary I should call on them and on
the rest), it was agreed that I should go forth and pay
visits, and that on my return Tom and I should dine some-
where together. I called upon Brown, upon Jones, upon
Smith, upon Robinson, upon our old Paris set, in a word,
and in due time returned to Tom Dash.

" Where are we to dine, Tom ? " says I. " What is the
crack restaurant now ? I am entirely in your hands ; and
let us be off early and go to the play afterwards."

" Oh, hang restaurants," says Tom — " Pm tired of *em ;
we are sick of them here. Thompson came in just after
you were gone, and I told him you were coming, and he will
be here directly to have a chop with me."

There was nothing for it. I had to sit down and dine
with Thompson and Tom Dash, at the latter's charges —
and am bound to say that the dinner was not a bad one.
As I have said somewhere before, and am proud of being
able to say, I scarcely recollect ever to have had a bad
dinner.

But of what do you think the present repast was com-
posed ? Sir, I give you my honor, we had a slice of salmon
and a leg of mutton, and boiled potatoes, just as they do in
my favorite Baker Street.

"Dev'lish good dinner," says Thompson, covering the
salmon with lots of Harvey sauce — and cayenne pepper,
from Fortnum & Mason's.

" Donnez du sherry k Monsieur Canterbury," says Tom
Dash to Fran9ois his man. " There's porter or pale ale if
any man likes it."

They poured me out sherry ; I might have had porter or
pale ale if I liked : I had leg of mutton and potatoes, and
finished dinner with Stilton cheese : and it was for this that
I have revisited my dear Paris.

" Thank you," says I to Dash, cutting into the mutton
with the most bitter irony. " This is a dish that I don't
remember ever having seen in England ; but I tasted pale
ale there, and won't take any this evening, thank you. Are
we going to have port wine after dinner ? or could you
oblige me with a little London gin-and-water ? "

Tom Dash laughed his mighty laugh ; and I will say we
had not port wine, but claret, fit for the repast of a pontiff,
after dinner, and sat over it so late that the theatre was im-
possible, and the first day was gone, and might as well have



ON SOME DINNERS AT PARIS, 313

been passed in Pump Court or Pall Mall, for all the good I .
had out of it.

But, Sir, do you know what had happened in the morn-
ing of that day during which I was paying the visits before
mentioned ?

Kobinson, my very old friend, pressed me so to come and
dine with him, and fix my day, that I could not refuse, and
fixed Friday.

Brown, who is very rich, and with whom I had had a differ-
ence, insisted so upon our meeting as in old times, that I
could not refuse ; and so being called on to appoint my own
day — I selected Sunday.

Smith is miserably poor, and it would offend him and
Mrs. Smith mortally that I should dine with a rich man,
and turn up my nose at his kind and humble table. I was
free to name any day I liked, and so I chose Monday.

Meanwhile, our old friend Jones had heard that I had
agreed to dine with Brown, with whom he, too, was at vari-
ance, and he offered downright to quarrel with me unless I
gave him a day : so I fixed Thursday.

" I have but Saturday," says I, with almost tears in my
eyes.

" Oh, I have asked a party of the old fellows to meet
you," cries out Tom Dash ; " and made a dinner expressly
for the occasion."

And this. Sir, was the fact. This was the way. Sir, that
I got my dinners at Paris. Sir, at one house I had boiled
leg of mutton and turnips, at another beefsteak ; and I give
you my word of honor, at two I had mock-turtle soup I In
this manner I saw Paris. This was what my friends called
welcoming me. We drank sherry ; we talked about Mr.
Cobden and the new financial reform ; I was not allowed to
see a single Frenchman, save one, a huge athletic monster,
whom I saw at a club in London last year, who speaks
English as well as you, and who drank two bottles of port
wine on that very night for his own share. I offended
mortally several old friends with whom I didn't dine, and
I might as well have been sitting under your mahogany tree
in Fleet Street, for all of Paris that I saw.

I have the honor to report my return to this country, and
to my lodgings in Piccadilly, and to remain.

Your very obedient servant and contributor,

FoLKSTONE Canterbury.

HOBSON'S CHOICE. 316



HOBSON'S CHOICE.

OR, THE TRIBULATIONS OF A GENTLEMAN IN SEARCH OF A

MAN-SERVANT.

1850.

I.

BEFOEE my wife^s dear mother, Mrs. Captain Budge,
came to live with us, — which she did on occasion of
the birth of our darling third child, Albert, named in compli-
ment to a Gracious Prince, and now seven and a half years
of age, — our establishment was in rather what you call a
small way, and we only had female servants in our kitchen.
I liked them, I own. I like to be waited on by a neat-
handed Phillis of a parlor-maid, in a nice fitting gown, and
a pink ribbon to her cap : and I do not care to deny that I
liked to have my parlor-maids good-looking. Not for any
reason such as jealousy might suggest — such reasons I
scorn ; but as, for a continuance and for a harmless recrea-
tion and enjoyment, I would much rather look out on a
pretty view of green fields and a shining river, from my
drawing-room window, than upon a blank wall, or an old-
clothesman's shop : so I am free to confess I would choose
for preference a brisk, rosy, good-natured, smiling lass to
put my dinner and tea before me on the table, rather than
a crooked, black-muzzled frump, with a dirty cap and black
hands. I say I like to have nice-looking people about me ;
and when I used to chuck my Anna Maria under the chin,
and say that was one of the reasons for which I married
her, I warrant you Mrs. H. was not offended ; and so she let
me have my harmless way about the parlor-maids. Sir, the
only way in which we lost our girls in our early days was
by marriage. One married the baker, and gives my boy
Albert gingerbread whenever he passes her shop ; one be-
came the wife of Policeman X., who distinguished himself
by having his nose broken in the Chartist riots ; and a

third is almost a lady, keeping her one-horse carriage, and
being wife to a carpenter and builder.

Well, Mrs. Captain Budge, Mrs. H.'s mother, or " Mam-
ma," as she insists that I should call her — and I do so, for
it pleases her warm and affectionate nature — came to stop
for a few weeks, on the occasion of our darling Albert's
birth, anno Domini 1842; and the child and its mother
being delicate, Mrs. Captain B. stayed to nurse them both,
and so has remained with us, occupying the room which
used to be my study and dressing-room ever since. When
she came to us, we may be said to have moved in a humble
sphere, viz. in Bernard Street, Foundling Hospital, which
we left four years ago for our present residence, Stucco
Gardens, Pocklington Square. And up to the period of
Mrs. Captain B.^s arrival we were, as I say, waited upon in
the parlor by maids ; the rough below-stairs work of knife
and shoe-cleaning being done by Grundsell, our green-
grocer's third son.

But though Heaven forbid that I should say a word
against my mother-in-law, who has a handsome sum to
leave, and who is besides a woman all self-denial, with her
every thought for our good; yet I think that without
Mamma my wife would not have had those tantrums, may
I call them, of jealousy, which she never exhibited pre-
viously, and which she certainly began to show very soon
after our dear little scapegrace of an Albert was born. We
had at that time, I remember, a parlor servant, called Emma
Buck, who came to us from the country, from a Doctor of
Divinity's family, and who pleased my wife very well at first,
as indeed she did all in her power to please her. But on the
very day Anna Maria came downstairs to the drawing-room,
being brought down in these very arms, which I swear be-
long to as faithful a husband as any in the City of Lon-
don, and Emma bringing up her little bit of dinner on a
tray, I observed Anna Maria's eyes look uncommon savage
at the poor girl, Mrs. Captain B. looking away the whole
time, on to whose neck my wife plunged herself as soon
as the girl had left the room ; bursting out into tears, and
calling somebody a viper.

"Hullo," says I, "my beloved, what is the matter?
Where's the viper ? I didn't know there were any in Ber-
nard Street " (for I thought she might be nervous still, and
wished to turn off the thing, whatever it might be, with
a pleasantry). " Who is the serpent ? "



HOBSOJSrS CHOICE. 317

"That — that — woman," gurgles out Mrs. H., sobbing
on Mamma's shoulder, and Mrs. Captain B. scowling sadly
at me over her daughter.

" What, Emma ? " I asked in astonishment ; for the girl
had been uncommonly attentive to her mistress, making
her gruels and things, and sitting up with her, besides
tending my eldest daughter, Emily, through the scarlet
fever.

" Emma ! don't say Emma in that cruel audacious way;
Marmaduke — Mr. Ho — o — obson," says my wife (for such
are my two names as given me by my godfathers and my
fathers). "You call the creature by her Christian name
before my very face ! "

" Oh, Hobson, Hobson ! " says Mrs. Captain B., wagging
her head.

" Confound it" — (" Don't swear," says Mamma) — " Con-
found it, my love," says I, stamping my foot, " you wouldn't
have me call the girl Buck, Buck, as if she was a rabbit ?
She's the best girl that ever was ; she nursed Emily through
the fever ; she has been attentive to you ; she is always up
when you want her — "

" Yes ; and when you-oo-oo come home from the club, Mar-
maduke," my wife shrieks out, and falls again on Mamma's
shoulder, who looks me in the face and nods her head fit to
drive me mad. I come home from the club, indeed ! Wasn't
I forbidden to see Anna Maria ? Wasn't I turned away a
hundred times from my wife's door by Mamma herself, and
could I sit alone in the dining-room (for my eldest two, a
boy and girl, were at school) — alone in the dining-room,
where that. very Emma would have had to wait upon me ?

Not one morsel of chicken would Anna Maria eat. (She
said she dared to say that woman would poison the egg-
sauce.) She had hysterical laughter and tears, and was in
a highly nei*vous state, a state as dangerous for the mother
as for the darling baby, Mrs. Captain B. remarked justly ;
and I was of course a good deal alarmed, and sent, or rather
went off, for Boker, our medical man. Boker saw his in-
teresting patient, said that her nerves were highly excited,
that she must at all sacrifices be kept quiet, and corrobo-
rated Mrs. Captain B.'s opinion in every particular. As we
walked downstairs I gave him a hint of what was the mat-
ter, at the same time requesting him to step into the back-
parlor, and there see me take an affidavit that I was as
innocent as the blessed baby just born, and named but
three days before after his Koyal Highness the Prince.



318 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

" I know, I know, my good fellow," says Boker, poking
me in the side (for he has a good deal of fun), " that you
are innocent. Of course you are innocent. Everybody is,
you sly dog. But what of that ? The two women have
taken it into their heads to be jealous of your maid — and
an uncommonly pretty girl she is too, Hobson, you sly
rogue, you. And were she a Vestal Virgin, the girl must
go if you want to have any peace in the house ; if you
want your wife and the little one to thrive — if you want
to have a quiet house and family. And if you do," says
Boker, looking me in the face hard, " though it is against
my own interest, will you let me give you a bit of advice,
old boy ? "

We had been bred up at Merchant Taylors together, and
had licked each other often and often, so of course I let
him speak.

" Well, then," says he, " Hob, my boy, get rid of the old
dragon — the old mother-in-law. She meddles with my
prescriptions for your wife ; she doctors the infant in pri-
vate : you'll never have a quiet house or a quiet wife as long
as that old Catamaran is here."

"Boker," says I, "Mrs. Captain Budge is a lady who
must not, at least in my house, be called a Catamaran. She
has seven thousand pounds in the funds, and always says
Anna Maria is her favorite daughter." And so we parted,
not on the best of terms, for I did not like Mamma to be
spoken of disrespectfully by any man.

What was the upshot of this ? When Mamma heard
from Anna Maria (who weakly told her what I had let slip
laughing, and in confidence to my wife) that Boker had
called her a Catamaran, of course she went up to pack her
trunks, and of course we apologized, and took another med-
ical man. And as for Emma Buck, there was nothing for
it but that she, poor girl, should go to the right about ; my
little Emily, then a child of ten years of age, crying bitterly
at parting with her. The child very nearly got me into a
second scrape, for I gave her a sovereign to give to Emma,
and she told her grandmamma: who would have related
all to Anna Maria, but that I went down on my knees, and
begged her not. But she had me in her power after that,
and made me wince when she would say, "Marmaduke,
have you any sovereigns to give away ? " etc.

After Emma Buck came Mary Blackmore, whose name I
remember because Mrs. Captain B. called her Mary Blacky-



HOBSON'S CHOICE. 319

more (and a dark swarthy girl she was, not at all good-
looking in my eyes). This poor Mary Blackmore was sent
about her business because she looked sweet on the two-
penny postman, Mamma said. And she knew, no doubt,
for (my wife being downstairs again long since) Mrs. B. saw
everything that was passing at the door as she regularly sat
in the parlor window.

After Blackmore came another girl of Mrs. B.'s own
choosing : own rearing, I may say, for she was named Bar-
bara, after Mamma, being a soldier^s daughter, and coming
from Portsea, where the late Captain Budge was quartered,
in command of his company of marines. Of this girl Mrs.
B. would ask questions out of the " Catechism '' at break-
fast, and my scapegrace of a Tom would burst out laughing
at her blundering answers. But from a demure country
lass, as she was when she came to us. Miss Barbara very
quickly became a dressy, impudent-looking thing ; coquet-
ting with the grocer's and butcher's boys, and wearing silk
gowns and flowers in her bonnet when she went to church
on Sunday evenings, and actually appearing one day with
her hair in bands, and the next day in ringlets. Of course
she was setting her cap at me. Mamma said, as I was the
only gentleman in the house, though for my part I declare
I never saw the set of her cap at all, or knew if her hair
was straight or curly. So, in a word, Barbara was sent
back to her mother, and Mrs. Budge didn't fail to ask me
whether I had not a sovereign to give her ?

After this girl we had two or three more maids, whose
appearance or history it is not necessary to particularize —
the latter was uninteresting, let it suffice to say ; the former
grew worse and worse.. I never saw such a woman as
Grizzel Scrimgeour, from Berwick-upon-Tweed, who was
the last that waited on us, and who was enough, I declare,
to curdle the very milk in the jug as she put it down to
breakfast.

At last the real aim of my two conspirators of women came
out. " Marmaduke," Mrs. Captain B. said to me one morn-
ing, after this Grizzel had brought me an oniony knife to
cut the bread ; " women servants are very well in their way,
but there is always something disagreeable with them, and
in families of a certain rank a man-servant commonly waits
at table. It is proper : it is decent that it should be so in
the respectable classes: and we are of those classes. In
Captain Budge's lifetime we were never without our groom,

and our tea-boy. My dear father had his butler and coach-
man, as our family has had ever since the Conquest ; and
though you are certainly in business, as your father was
before you, yet your relations are respectable : your grand-
father was a dignified clergyman in the West of England ;
you have connections both in the army and navy, who are
members of Clubs and known in the fashionable world ; and
(though I shall never speak to that man again) remember
that your wife's sister is married to a barrister who lives on
Oxford Square, and goes the Western Circuit. He keeps a
man-servant. They keep men-servants, and I do not like
to see my poor Anna Maria occupying an inferior position
in society to her sister Frederica, named after the Duke of
York though she was, when his Royal Highness reviewed
the Marines at Chatham; and seeing some empty bottles
carried from the table, said " —

" In mercy's name," says I, bursting out, for when she
came to this story Mamma used to drive me frantic, " have
a man, if you like, ma'am, and give me a little peace."

"You needn't swear, Mr. Hobson," she replied with a
toss of her head ; and when I went to business that day it
was decided by the women that our livery should be set up.



HOBSON'S CHOICE.



II.

ETER QEUNDSELL, the knife-
boy, the youth previously men-
tioned as son of my greengrocer
and occasional butler, a. demure
little fair-haired lad, who had
received his education in a



Blaizc's Charity School, was
our first foot-boy or page.
Mamma thought that a full-
sized footman might occasion
inconvenience in the house,
and would not be able to sleep
in our back attic (which in-
deed was scarcely six feet long),
and she had somehow conceived
a great fondness for this youth
with his pale cheeks, blue eyes
and yellow hair, who sang the
sweetest of all the children in
the organ-loft of Saint Blaizo'a. At five o'clock every
morning, winter and summer, that boy, before he took a
permanent engagement in my establishment, slid down our
area steps, of which and of the kitchen entrance he was en-
trusted with the key. He crept up the stairs aa silent as a
cat, and carried ofE the boots and shoes from the doors of
our respective apartments without disturbing one of us :
the knives and shoes of my domestic circle were cleaned as
brilliant aa possible before six o'clock ; he did odd jobs for
the cook ; he went upon our messages and errands ; he car-
ried out bis father's potatoes and cauliflowers ; he attended
school at St. Blaize's ; he turned his mother's mangle : —
there was no end to the work that boy could do in the
course of a day, and he was tbe most active, quiet, bumble
little rogue you ever knew. Mrs. Captain Budge then took
a just likii^ to the lad, and resolved to promote him to the

situation of page. His name was changed from Peter to
Philip, as being more genteel ; and a hat with a gold cord
and a knob on the top like a gilt Brussels sprout, and a
dark green suit, with a white galloon stripe down the
trouser-seams, and a bushel of buttons on the jacket, were
purchased at an establishment in Holborn, off the dummy
at the door. Mamma is a great big strong woman, with a
high spirit, who, I should think, could protect herself very-
well ; but when Philip had his livery, she made him walk
behind her regularly, and never could go to church without
Philip after her to carry the books, or out to tea of an even-
ing without that boy on the box of the cab.

Mrs. Captain B. is fond of good living herself ; and, to
do her justice, always kept our servants well. I don't
meddle with the kitchen affairs myself, having my own
business to attend to ; but I believe my servants had as
much meat as they could eat, and a great deal more than
was good for them. They went to bed pretty soon, for
ours was an early house, and when I came in from the City
after business, I was glad enough to get to bed ; and they
got up rather late, for we are all good sleepers (especially
Mrs. B., who takes a heavy supper, which / never could in-
dulge in), so that they were never called upon to leave their
beds much before seven o'clock, and had their eight or nine
good hours of rest every night.

And here I cannot help remarking, that if these folks
knew their luck — sua si bona norint, as we used to say at
Merchant Taylors ; if they remembered that they are fed
as well as lords, that they have warm beds and plenty of
sleep in them ; that, if they are ill, they have frequently
their master's doctor ; that they get good wages, and beer,
and sugar and tea in sufficiency : they need not be robbing
their employers or taking fees from tradesmen, or grum-
bling at their lot. My friend and head-clerk Eaddles has a
hundred and twenty a year and eight children ; the Rever-
end Mr. Bittles, our esteemed curate at Saint Blaize's, has
the same stipend and family of three ; and I am sure that
both of those gentlemen work harder, and fare worse, than
any of the servants in my kitchen, or my neighbor's. And
I, who have seen that dear, good elegant angel * of a Mrs.

* I say this, because I think so, and will not be put down. My wife says
she thinks there is nothing in Mrs. Bittles, and Mamma says she gives her-

HOB SON'S CHOICE. 823

Bittles ironing her husband's bands and neckcloths; and
that uncommonly shy supper of dry bread and milk-and-
water, which the Eaddles family take when I have dropped
in to visit them at their place (Glenalvon Cottage, Magnolia
Road South, Camden Town), on my walks from Hampstead
on a Sunday evening : — I say, I, who have seen these peo-
ple, and thought about my servants at home, on the same
July evening, eating buttered toast round the kitchen fire
— have marvelled how resigned and contented some people
were, and how readily other people grumbled.

Well, then, this young Philip being introduced into my
family, and being at that period as lean as a whipping-post,
and as contented with the scraps and broken victuals which
the cook gave him, as an alderman with his turtle and veni-
son, now left his mother's mangle — on which or on a sack
in his father's potato-bin, he used to sleep — and put on my
buttons and stripes, waited at my own table, and took his
regular place at that in the kitchen, and occupied a warm
bed and three blankets in the back attic.

The effect of the three (or four or five, is it ? — for the
deuce knows how many they take) meals a day upon the
young rascal was speedily evident in his personal appear-
ance. His lean cheeks began to fill out till they grew as
round and pale as a pair of suet dumplings. His dress
from the little dummy in Holborn (a bargain of Mrs. Cap-
tain B.'s), which was always a tight fit, grew tighter and
tighter ; as if his meals in the kitchen were not sufficient
for any two Christians, the little gormandizer levied con-
tributions upon our parlor dishes. And one day my wife
spied him with his mouth smeared all over with our jam-
pudding ; and on another occasion he came in with tears in
his eyes and hardly able to speak, from the effects of a
curry on which he had laid hands in the hall, and which we
make (from the Nawob of MuUigatawney's own receipt) re-
markably fine, and as hot, as hot — as the dog-days.

As for the crockery, both the common blue and the stone
china Mamma gave us on our marriage (and which, I must
confess, I didn't mind seeing an end of, because she bragged
and bothered so about it), the smashes that boy made were
incredible. The handles of all the tea-cups went ; and the
knobs off the covers of the vegetable dishes ; and the stems
of the wine-glasses; and the china punch-bowl my Anna
Maria was christened in. And the days he did not break
the dishes on the table, he spilt the gravy on the cloth.

Lord ! Lord ! how I did wish for my pretty neat little paj^
lor-maid agaiu. But I had beat not, for peace' sake, en-
large again upon that point.

And as for getting up, I suppose the suppers and din-
ners made him sleepy as well as fat; certainly the little
rascal for the first week did get up at his usual hour : then
he was a little later : at the end of a month he came yawn-




ing downstairs after the maids had long been at work ;
there was no more polishing of boots and knives barely
time to get mine clean, and knives enough ready for me
and my wife's breakfast (Mrs. Captain B. taking hers and
her poached eggs and rashers of oacon in bed) — in time
enough, I say, for my breakfast, before I went into the
City.
Many and many a scolding did I give that boy, until, my



HOBSON'S CHOICE. 326

temper being easy and the lad getting no earthly good from
my abuse of him, I left off — from sheer weariness and a
desire for a quiet life. But Mamma, to do her justice, was
never tired of giving it to him, and rated him up hill and
down dale. It was " Philip, you are a fool ; " " Philip, you
dirty wretch ; " " Philip, you sloven," and so forth, all din-
ner-time. But still, when I talked of sending him off, Mrs.
Captain B. always somehow pleaded for him and insisted
upon keeping him. Well. My weakness is that I can't
say no to a woman, and Master Philip stayed on, breaking
the plates and smashing the glass, and getting more mis-
chievous and lazy every day.

At last there came a crash, which, though it wasn't in
my crockery, did Master Philip's business. Hearing a great
laughter in the kitchen one evening, Mamma (who is a
good housekeeper, and does not like her servants to laugh
on any account) stepped down, — and what should she
find ? — Master Philip, mimicking her to the women ser-
vants, and saying, " Look, this is the way old Mother Budge
goes ! " And pulling a napkin round his head (something
like the Turkish turban Mrs. Captain B. wears), he began
to speak as if in her way, saying, " Now, Philip, you nasty,
idle, good-for-nothing, lazy, dirty boy you, why do you go
for to spill the gravy so ? " etc.

Mrs. B. rushed forward and boxed his ears soundly, and
the next day he was sent about his business ; for flesh and
blood could bear him no longer.

Why he had been kept so long, as I said before, I could
not comprehend, until after Philip had left us ; and then
Mamma said, looking with tears in her eyes at the chap's
jacket, as it lay in the pantry, that her little boy Augustus
was something like him, and he wore a jacket with buttons
of that sort. Then I knew she was thinking of her eldest
son, Augustus Frederick York Budge, a midshipman on
board the "Hippopotamus" frigate. Captain Swang, C. B.

on the West India Station in the year 1814.

BY the time I had had two or three more boys in my
family, I got to hate them as if I had been a second
Herod, and the rest of my household, too, was pretty soon
tired of the wretches. If any young housekeepers read
this, I would say to them, Profit by my experience, and
never keep a boy; be happy with a parlor-maid, put up
with a char-woman, let the cook bring up your dinner from
the kitchen ; get a good servant who knows his business,
and pay his wages as cheerfully as you may ; but never
have a boy into your place, if you value your peace of
mind.

You may save a little in the article of wages with the lit-
tle rascal, but how much do you pay in discomfort ! A boy
eats as much as a man, a boy breaks twice as much as a
man, a boy is twice as long upon an errand as a man ; a boy
batters your plate and sends it up to table dirty ; you are
never certain that a boy's fingers are not in the dish which
he brings up to your dinner ; a boy puts your boots on the
wrong trees ; and when at the end of a year or two he has
broken his way through your crockery, and at last learned
some of his business, the little miscreant privately adver-
tises himself in the Times as a youth who has two years'
character, and leaves you for higher wages and another
place. Two young traitors served me so in the course of
my fatal experience with boys.

Then, in a family council, it was agreed that a man should
be engaged for our establishment, and we had a series of
footmen. Our curate recommended to me our first man,
whom the clergyman had found in the course of his chari-
table excursions. I took John Tomkins out of the garret
where he was starving. He had pawned every article of
value belonging to him ; he had no decent clothes left in
which he could go out to offer himself for a situation ; he
had not tasted meat for weeks, except such rare bits as he
could get from the poor curate's spare table. He came to
my house, and all of a sudden rushed into plenty again.



HOBSON'S CHOICE, 327

He had a comfortable supply of clothes, mfeat, fire, blan-
kets. He had not a hard master, and as for Mamma's
scolding he took it as a matter of course. He had but few
pairs of shoes to clean, and lived as well as a man of five
hundred a year. Well, John Tomkins left my service in
six months after he had been drawn out of the jaws of
death, and after he had considered himself lucky at being
able to get a crust of bread, because the cook served him a
dinner of cold meat two days running — " He never 'ad
been used to cold meat ; it was the custom in no good fam-
'lies to give cold meat — he wouldn't stay where it was
practised." And away he went, then — very likely to
starve again.

Him there followed a gentleman whom I shall call Mr.
Abershaw, for I am positive he did it, although we never
could find him out. We had a character with this amiable
youth which an angel might have been proud of — had lived
for seven years with General Hector — only left because
the family was going abroad, the General being made Gov-
ernor and Commander-in-Chief of the Tapioca Islands —
the General's sister, Mrs. Colonel Ajax, living in lodgings
in the Edgware Road, answered for the man, and for the
authenticity of the General's testimonials. When Mamma,
Mrs. Captain B., waited upon her, Mrs. Captain B. remarked
that Mrs. Colonel's lodgings were rather queer, being shabby
in themselves, and over a shabbier shop — and she thought
there was a smell of hot spirits and water in Mrs. Colonel's
room when Mrs. B. entered it at one o'clock ; but, perhaps,
she was not very rich, the Colonel being on half-pay, and
it might have been ether and not rum which Mrs. B. smelt.
She came home announcing that she had found a treasure
of a servant, and Mr. Abershaw stepped into our pantry
and put on our livery.

Nothing could be better for some time than this gentle-
man's behavior; and it was edifying to remark how he
barred up the house of a night, and besought me to see that
the plate was all right when he brought it upstairs in the
basket. He constantly warned us, too, of thieves and ras-
cals about ; and, though he had a villanous hang-dog look
of his own, which I could not bear, yet Mamma said this
was only a prejudice of mine, and, indeed, I had no fault
to find with the man. Once I thought something was
wrong with the lock of my study-table ; but, as I keep lit-
tle or no money in the house, I did not give this circum-

stance much thought ; and once Mrs. Captain Budge saw
Mr. Abershaw in conversation with a lady who haul very
much the appearance of Mrs. Colonel Ajax, as she after-
wards remembered, but the resemblance did not, unluckily,
strike Mamma at the time.

It happened one evening that we all went to see the
Christmas pantomime ; and of course took the footman on
the box of the fly, and I treated him to the pit, where I
could not see him ; but he said afterwards that he enjoyed
the play very much. When the pantomime was over, he
was in waiting in the lobby to hand us back to the carriage,
and a pretty good load we were — our three children, our-
selves, and Mrs. Captain B., who is a very roomy woman.

When we got home — the cook, with rather a guilty and
terrified look, owned to her mistress that a most '* singlar "
misfortune had happened. She was positive she shut the
door — she could take her Bible oath she did — after the
boy who comes eveiy evening with the paper ; but the po-
liceman, about eleven o'clock, had rung and knocked to say
that the door was open — and open it was, sure enough ; and
a great-coat, and two hats, and an umbrella were gone.

" Thank 'Evins ! the plate was all locked up safe in my
pantry,'' Mr. Abershaw said, turning up his eyes ; and he
showed me that it was all right before going to bed that
very night ; he could not sleep unless I counted it, he said
— and then it was that he cried out. Lord ! Lord ! to think
that while he was so happy and unsuspicious, enjoyin' of
himself at the play, some rascal should come in and rob his
kind master ! If he'd a know'd it, he never would have
left the house — no, that he wouldn't.

He was talking on in this way, when we heard a loud
shriek from Mamma's room, and her bell began to ring like
mad : and presently out she ran, roaring out, " Anna Maria !
Cook ! Mr. Hobson ! Thieves ! I'm robbed, I'm robbed ! "

" Where's the scoundrel ? " says Abershaw, seizing the
poker as valiant as any man I ever saw ; and he rushed up-
stairs towards Mrs. B.'s apartment, I following behind, more
leisurely ; for, if the rascal of a housebreaker had pistols
with him, how was I to resist him, I should like to know ?

But when I got up — there was no thief. The scoundrel
had been there : but he was gone : and a large box of Mrs.
B.'s stood in the centre of the room, burst open, with num-
bers of things strewn about the floor. Mamma was sob-
bing her eyes out, in her big chair ; my wife and the female



HOB SON'S CHOICE. 329

servants already assembled ; and Abershaw, with the poker,
banging under the bed to see if the villain was still there.

I was not aware at first of the extent of Mrs. B.'s misfor-
tune, and it was only by degrees, as it were, that that un-
fortunate lady was brought to tell us what she had lost.
First, it was her dresses she bemoaned, two of which, her
rich purple velvet and her black satin, were gone ; then, it
was her Cashmere shawl ; then, a box full of ornaments,
her jet, her pearls, and her garnets ; nor was it until the
next day that she confessed to my wife that the great loss
of all was an old black velvet reticule, containing two hun-
dred and twenty-three pounds in gold and notes. I sup-
pose she did not like to tell me of this ; for a short time
before, being somewhat pressed for money, I had asked her
to lend me some ; when, I am sorry to say, the old lady
declared, upon her honor, that she had not a guinea, nor
should have one until her dividends came in. Now, if she
had lent it to me, she would have been paid back again, and
this she owned with tears in her eyes.

Well, when she had cried and screamed sufficiently, as
none of this grief would mend matters, or bring back her
money, we went to bed, Abershaw clapping to all the bolts
of the house-door, and putting the great bar up with a
clang that might be heard all through the street. And
it was not until two days after the event that I got the
numbers of the notes which Mrs. Captain B. had lost, and
which were all paid into the Bank, and exchanged for gold,
the morning after the robbery.

When I was aware of its extent, and when the horse was
stolen, of course I shut the stable-door, and called in a
policeman — not one of your letter X policemen — but a
gentleman in plain clothes, who inspected the premises, ex-
amined the family, and questioned the servants one by one.
This gentleman's opinion was that the robbery was got
up in the house. First he suspected the cook, then he in-
clined towards the housemaid, and the young fellow with
whom; as it appeared, that artful hussy was keeping com-
pany ; and those two poor wretches expected to be carried
off to jail forthwith, so great was the terror under which
they lay.

All this while Mr. Abershaw gave the policeman every
information ; insisted upon having his boxes examined and
his accounts looked into, for though he was absent, waiting
upon his master and mistress, on the night when the rob-

Here my young man was known as an old practitioner on
the treadmill, and. seeing there was no use in denying the
fact, he confessed it very caniiidly. He owned that he had
been unfortunate in his youth ; that he had not been in
General Hectors service these five vears : that the charac-
ter he had got was a sham one, and Mrs. Ajax merely a
romantic fiction. But no more would he acknowledge. His
whole desire in life, he said, was to be an honest man ; and
ever since he had entered mv service he had acted as such.
Could I point out a single instance in which he had failed to
do his duty ? But there was no use in a poor fellow who
had met with misfortune trying to retrieve himself : he began
to cry when he said this, and spoke so naturally that I was
almost inclined to swear that I had seen him under us all
night in the pit of the theatre.

There was no evidence against him ; and this good man
was discharged, both from the Police Office and from our
service, where he couldn't abear to stay, he said, now that
his Honor was questioned. And Mrs. Budge believed in
his innocence, and persisted in turning off the cook and
housemaid, who she was sure had stolen her money ; nor
was she quite convinced of the contrary two years after,
when Mr. Abershaw and Mrs. Colonel Ajax were both trans-
ported for forgery.

(being a letter from MR. J S PLUSH TO A FRIEND.)

1850.

Whbll op Fortune Barr,
Jenyoury twenty-JUh,

MY DEAE EINCEE, — Me and Mary Hann was very
much pleased with the box of f eznts and woodcox,
which you sent us, both for the attention which was deUy-
git, and because the burds was uncommon good and full of
flaviour. Some we gev away : some we hett : and I leave
you to emadgin that the Mann as sent em will holways find
a glass of somethink comf orable in our Barr ; and I hope
youll soon come back to London, Eincer, my boy. Your
account of the Servants' all festiwaties at Fitzbattleaxe
Castle, and your dancing Sir Eodjydycovyly (I don't know
how to spell it) with Lady Hawguster, emused Mary Hann
very much. That sottathing is very well — oust a year or
so : but in my time I thought the fun didnt begin until
the great folks had gone away. Give my kind suvvices to
Mrs. Lupin, and tell Munseer Beshymell with my and Mary
Hann's best wishes, that our little Fanny can play several
tunes on his pianner. Comps to old Coachy.

Till parlymint nothink is stirring, and theres no noose to
give you or fill my sheat — igsept (and I dessay this will
surprize you) — igsept I talk about tne new Play.

Although Im not genly a patternizer of the Drammer,
which it interfears very much with my abbits and ixpeshly
is not plesnt dareckly after dinner to set hoff to a cold
theayter for a middle-Hage Mann, who likes to take things
heazy ; yet, my dear feller, I do from time to time step in
(with a border) to the walls of the little Aymarket or old
Dewry, sometimes to give a treat to Mrs. Jeames and the
younguns, somefcimes to wild away a hidle hour when shes
outatown or outatemper (which sometimes will ocur in the

best reglated famlies you know) or when some private mel-
lumeolly or sorrer of my own is a hagitating hof me.

Yesdy evening it was none of these motifs which injuiced
me to go to the theayter — I had heard there was a com-
mady jest brought out, inwolving the earrickter of our pro-
fession — that prof eshn which you and me, Mr. Eincer, did
oust belong to. I'm not above that prof eshn; I ave its
hintarests and Honor at art : and of hevery man that wears
the Plush, I say that Mann is my Brother — (not that I
need be phonder of him for that; on the contry, I reck-
lect at our school where I lunt the fust rules of athography
and grammer, the Brothers were holwis a pitchen into
heach other) — but in fine, I love the Plush of hold days,
and hah! I regret that hold Father Time is doing some-
think to my Air, which wightns it more pumminantly than
the Powder which once I war !

A commady, Sir, has been brought out (which Im sur-
prized it aint been mentioned at my Barr, though to be sure
mose gents is keeping Grismass Olydays in the Country) in
which I was creddably informed — one of hus — one of the
old Plushes — why should I ezitate to say, a Footman,
forms the prinsple drammitis-pursony. How is my horder
represented on the British Stage I hast myself ? Are we
spoke of respeckful or otherwise ? Does anybody snear at
our youniform or purf eshn ? I was determingd to see ; and
in case of hanythink inslant being said of us, I took a key
with me in horder to iss propply ; and bought sevral hor-
ringers jest to make uce of em if I sor any nesessaty.

My dear Eincer. I greave to say, that though there was
nothink against our purfeshn said in the pease — and
though the most delligit and sensatif footman (and Ive
known no men of more dellixy of feelin and sensabillaty
than a well-reglated footman is whether hin or hout oi livry)
could find folt with the languidge of the New Commady of
" Leap Year,'' yet its prinsples is dangerous to publick mar
ralaty, as likewise to our beloved purfeshn.

The plot of the Pease is founderd upon a hancient Lor,
which the Hauther, Mr. Buckstone, discowred in an un-
common hold book, and by which it epears that in Lip-Year
(or whats called Bissixdile in Istronnamy) it is the women
who have the libbaty of choosing their usbands, and not as in
hornary times, the men who choose their wives (I reckmend
you old feller who are a reglar hold Batchylor, to look out
in the Ormnack for Lip Year, and kip hout of the way that



THOUGHTS ON A NEW COMEDY. 333

year) and this pragtice must be common anough in Heng-
land, for a eommady is a reprasentation of natur, and in
this one, every one of the women asts every one of the men
to marry : igsept one, and she asts two of em.

Onst upon a time there was an old genlmn by the name of
Flowerdew as married a young woman, who became in con-
squince Mrs. Flora Flowerdew. She made this hold buck
so Appy during the breaf coarse of his meddrimonial career,
that he left a will, bordering her to marry agin before three
years was over, failing vich, hevary shillin of his proppaty
should go to his nex Hair. Aving maid these destimentry
erangements hold Flowerdew died. Peace be to his Hashes !

His widder didnt cry much (for betwigst you and me F.
must have been rayther a silly old feller), but lived on in a
genteal manner in a house somewhere in the drecshon of
Amstid I should think, entertaining her f rends like a lady :
and like a lady she kep her coachman and groom : had her
own maid, a cook & housemaid of coarse, a page and a
MANN.

If I had been a widder I would have choas a Man of a
better Ithe, than Mrs. Flower jew did. Nothink becomes a
footman so much as Ithe. Its that which dixtinguidges us
from the wulgar, and I greave to say in this pedicklar the
gentleman as hacted Villiam Valker, Mrs. F's man, was
sadly defishnt. He was respeckble, quiet, horderly, hactive
— but his figger I must say was no go. You and me
Rincer ave seen footmen and know whats the proper sort —
seen em ? Hah, what men there was in hour time ! Do
you recklect Bill the Maypole as was with us at Lord Am-
mersmiths? What a chap that was! what a leg he ad!
The young men are not like us, Tom Rincer, — but I am
diwerging from my tail, which I reshume.

I diddnarive at the commensment of the drammer (for
their was a Purty a settling his skower in my Barr which
kep me a cumsederable time), but when I hentered the
theaytre I fown myself in presnts of Mr. & Mrs. C. Kean in
a droring-roomb, Mrs. K. at a tabble pertending to right let-
ters, or to so aiikyshuffs, or somethink, Mr. K. a elapsing
his &s, a rowling his hi's, and a quoating poatry & Byrom
and that sort of thing like anythink.

Mrs. Kean, she was the widdo, and Mr. K. he was Villiam
the man. He wasnt a Buttler dear Rincer like U. He
wasnt groom of the Chimbers like Mr. Mewt at my lords
(to whomb my best complymince), he wasnt a mear footman.



334 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

he wasnt a page : but lie was a mixter of all 4. He had
trowzies like a page with a red strip ; he had a coat like a
Hunndress John; he had the helegant mistary of Mr.
Mewt, and there was a graceful abanding and a daggijay
hair about him which I whish it was more adopted in our
purfeshn.

Haltho in hour time, dear Rincer, we didn quoat Byrom
and Shikspyer in the droring-room to the ladies of the
famly, praps things is haltered sins the marge of hintalect,
and the young Jeamses do talk potry. — Well, for sevral
years, during which he had been in Mrs. F/s service, Walker
had been going on in this manner, and it was heasy at once
to see at the very hopening of the pease, from the manner
of missis and man, that there was more than the common
sewillaties of a lady and a genlman in livary goin on be-
tween em, and in one word that they were pashintly in love
with each other. This wont surprize you Eincer, my boy ;
and in the coarse of my expearance I might tell a story or
two — Lady Harabellar; but Honor forbids, and Im
mumm.

Several shutors come to whoo the widow ; but none, and
no great wonder, have made an impreshn on her heart.
One she takes as a husband on trial — and he went out to
dinner on the very fust day of his apprentiship, and came
home intogsicated. Another whomb she would not have, a
Captain in the Harmy, pulls out a bill when she refuses him,
and requestes her to pay for his loss of time, and the clothes
he has bordered in border to captiwate her. Finely the
piece hends by the widdo proposing to William Walker, her
servant, and marrying that pusson.

I don't hask whether widdos take usbands on trial, I do
not pores to inquier whether Captings send in bills of costs
for courtship, or igsamming other absuddaties in this Com-
mady. I look at it purfeshnly, and I look at it gravely,
Rincer. Hand, I can't help seeing that it is dangerous to
our border, and subwussive of domestic maralaty.

I say theres a Prinsple in a honist footman which should
make him purtest and rewolt against such doctorings as
these. A f atle pashn may hapn hany day to hany Mann ;
as a chimbly-pott may drop on his head, or a homnibus
drive hover him. We cant help falling in love with a fine
woman — we are men : we are fine men praps ; and praps
she returns our harder. But whats the use of it ? There
can be no marridges between footmen and families in which



THOUGHTS ON A NEW COMEDY. 335

they live. There's a Lor of Natur against it, and it should
be wrote in the prayer-books for the use of Johns that a
man may not marry his Missus. — If this kind of thing was
to go on hoften, there would be an end to domestic life.
John would be holways up in the droring-room courting : or
Miss would be for hever down in the pantry : you'd get no
whirk done. How could he clean his plate propply with
Miss holding one of his ands sittin on the knife bord ? It's
impawsable. We may marry in other families but not in
our hown. We have each our spears as we have each our
Bells. Theirs is the first flor ; hours is the basemint. A
man who marris his Missis hingers his purfeshnal bruther-
ing. I would cut that Man dedd who married his Missis.
I would blackbawl him at the clubb. Let it onst git abroad
that we do so, and famlies will leave off iring footmen hal-
together and be weighted upon by maids, which the young
ladies cant marry them, and I leave you to say whether the
purfeshn isnt a good one, and whether it woodnt be a pity

THE SIGHTS OF LONDON.

1850.

SIR, — I am a country gentleman, infirm in health,
stricken in years, and only occasionally visiting the
metropolis, of which the dangers, and the noise and the
crowds, are somewhat too much for my quiet nerves. But
at this season of Easter, having occasion to come to Lon-
don, where my son resides, I was induced to take his car-
riage and his five darling children for a day's sight-seeing.*
And of sight-seeing I have had. Sir, enough, not for a day,
but for my whole life.

My son's residence is in the elegant neighborhood of
P-rtm-n Square ; and taking his carriage, of which both
the horse and driver are perfectly steady and past the
prime of life, our first visit was to the Tenebrorama, in the
Regent's Park, where I was told some neat paintings were
exhibited, and I could view some scenes at least of foreign
countries without the danger and fatigue of personal travel.
I paid my money at the entrance of the building, and en-
tered with my unsuspicious little charges into the interior
of the building. Sir, it is like the entrance to the Eleusin-
ian mysteries, or what I have been given to understand is
the initiation into Freemasonry. We plunged out of the
light into such a profound darkness, that my darling Anna
Maria instantly began to cry. We felt we were in a cham-
ber. Sir, dimly creaking and moving underneath us — a
horrid sensation of sea-sickness and terror overcame us,
and I was almost as frightened as my poor innocent Anna
Maria.

The first thing we saw was a ghastly view of a church —
the Cathedral of Saint Sepulchre's, at Jericho, I believe it
was called — a dreary pile, with not a soul in it, not so
much as a pew-opener or verger to whom one could look for
refuge from the dismal solitude. Sir, I don't care to own I
am frightened at being in a church alone; I was once
locked up in one at the age of thirteen, having fallen



THE SIGHTS OF LONDON, 337

asleep during the sermon ; and though I have never seen a
ghost, they are in my family : my grandmother saw one. I
hate to look at a great ghastly, naked edifice, paved with
gravestones, and surrounded with epitaphs and death's-
heads, and I own that I thought a walk in the Park would
have been more cheerful than this.

As we looked at the picture, the dreary church became
more dreary ; the shadows of night (by means of curtains
and contrivances, which I heard in the back part of the
mystery making an awful flapping and pulling) fell deeply
and more terribly on the scene. It grew pitch dark ; my
poor little ones clung convulsively to my knees ; an or-
gan commenced playing a dead-march — it was midnight —
tapers presently began to flicker in the darkness — the or-
gan to moan more dismally — and suddenly, by a hideous
optical delusion, the church was made to appear as if full
of people, the altar was lighted up with a mortuary illumi-
nation, and the dreadful monks were in their stalls.

I have been in churches. I have thought the sermon
long. I never thought the real service so long as that
painted one which I witnessed at the Tenebrorama. My
dear children whispered, " Take us out of this place, Grand-
papa." I would have done so. I started to get up (the
place being now dimly visible to our eyes, accustomed to
the darkness, and disclosing two other wretches looking on
in the twilight besides ourselves) — I started, I say, to get
up, when the chamber began to move again, and I saik
back on my seat, not daring to stir.

The next view we saw was the summit of Mount Ararat,
I believe, or else of a mountain in Switzerland, just before
dawn. I can't bear looking down from mountains or
heights ; when taken to St. Paul's by my dear mother as
a child, I had wellnigh fainted when brought out into the
outer gallery ; and this view of Mount Ararat is so dread-
ful, so lonely, so like nature, that it was all I could do to
prevent myself from dashing down the peak and plunging
into the valley below. A storm, the thunderous rumble of
which made me run cold, the fall of an avalanche destroy-
ing a village, some lightning, and an eclipse I believe of the
sun, were introduced as ornaments to this picture, which I
would as lief see again as undergo a nightmare.

More dead than alive, I took my darling children out of
the place, and tenderly embraced them when I was out of
the door.



338 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

The Haidorama is next by, and my dear little third grand-
child insisted upon seeing it. Sir, we unsuspecting ones
went into the place, and saw — what do you think ? — the
Earthquake of Lisbon ! Ships were tossed and dashed about
the river before us in a frightful manner. Convents and
castles toppled down before our eyes and burst into flames.
We heard the shrieks of the mariners in the storm, the
groans of the miserable people being swallowed up or
smashed in the rocking reeling ruins — tremendous dark-
ness, lurid lightning flashes, and the awful booming of
thunderbolts roared in our ears, dazzled our eyes, and
frightened our senses so, that I protest I was more dead
than alive when I quitted the premises, and don't know
how I found myself in my carriage.

We were then driven to the Zoological Gardens, a place
which I often like to visit (keeping away from the larger
beasts, such as the bears, who I often fancy may jump from
their poles upon certain unoffending Christians ; and the
howling tigers and lions who are continually biting the
keepers' heads off), and where I like to look at the monkeys
in the cages (the little rascals !) and the birds of various
plumage.

Fancy my feelings. Sir, when I saw in these gardens —
in these gardens frequented by nursery-maids, mothers, and
children, an immense brute of an elephant, about a hundred
feet high, rushing about with a wretched little child on his
back, and a single man vainly endeavoring to keep him
back! I uttered a shriek — I called my dear children
round about me. And I am not ashamed to confess it, Sir,
I ran. I ran for refuge into a building hard by, where I
saw — ah. Sir ! I saw an immense boa-constrictor swallow-
ing a live rabbit — swallowing a live rabbit. Sir, and look-
ing as if he would have swallowed one of my little boys
afterwards. Good heavens ! Sir, do we live in a Christian
country, and are parents and children to be subjected to
sights like these ?

Our next visit — of pleasure. Sir ! bear with me when I
say pleasure — was to the Waxwork in Baker Street ; of
which I have only to say, that, rather than be left alone in
that gallery at night with those statues, I would consent to
be locked up with one of the horrid lions at the Zoological
Gardens. There is a woman in black there lying on a sofa,
and whose breast heaves ; there is an old man whose head
is always slowly turning round ; there is Her M ^y and

the E-y-1 Children looking as if they all had the yellow
fever; sights enough to terrify any Christian I should
think, — sights which, nevertheless, as a man and a grand-
father, I did not mind undergoing.

But my second boy. Tommy, a prying little dare-devil,
full of mischief, must insist upon our going to what he
called the reserved apartment, where Napoleon's carriage
was, he said, and other curiosities. Sir, he caused me to
pay sixpences for all the party, and introduced me to
what? — to the Chamber of Horrors, Sir! — they're not
ashamed to call it so — they're proud of the frightful title
and the dreadful exhibition — and what did I there behold
— murderers. Sir, — murderers ; some of them in their own
cold blood — Robespierre's head off in a plate — Marat
stuck and bleeding in a bath — Mr. and Mrs. Manning in a
frightful colloquy with Courvoisier and Fieschi about the
infernal machine — and my child, my grandchild. Sir,
laughed at my emotion and ridiculed his grandfather's just
terror at witnessing this hideous scene !

Jacky, my fifth, is bound for India — and wished to see
the Overland Journey portrayed, which, as I also am inter-
ested in the future progress of that darling child, I was
anxious to behold. We came into the Exhibition, Sir, just
at the moment when the Simoom was represented. Have
you ever seen a simoom, Sir ? Can you figure to yourself
what a simoom is ? — a tornado of sand in which you die
before you can say Jack Robinson ; in which camels, horses,
men, are swept into death in an instant — and this was the
agreeable sight which, as a parent and a man, I was called
upon to witness ! Shuddering, and calling my little charges
around me, I quitted Waterloo Place, and having treated
the dear beings to a few buns in the Haymarket, conducted
them to their last place of amusement, viz. the Panorama,
in Leicester Place.

Ah, Sir ! of what clay are mortals supposed to be made,
that they can visit that exhibition ? Dreams I have had in
my life, but as that view of the Arctic Regions nothing so
teiTible. My blood freezes as I think of that frightful
summer even — but what to say of the winter ? By heav-
ens, Sir ! I could not face the sight — the icy picture of
eternal snow — the livid northern lights, the killing glitter
of the stars ; the wretched mariners groping about in the
snow round the ship ; they caused in me such a shudder of
surprise and fright, that I don't blush to own T popped

down the curtain after one single peep, and would not allow

Are others to be so alarmed, so misled, so terrified ? I

THE LION HUNTRESS OF BEL GR A VIA. 341



THE LION HUNTRESS OF BELGRAVIA.

BEING LADY NIMROD's JOURNAL OF THE PAST SEASON.

1850.
I.

WHEN my husband's father, Sir John Nimrod, died,
after sixteen years' ill-health, which ought to have
killed a dozen baronets, and which I bore, for my part, with
angelic patience, we came at length into the property which
ought, by rights, to have been ours so long before (other-
wise, I am sure, I would never have married Nimrod, or
gone through eighteen years of dulness and comparative
poverty in second-rate furnished houses, at home and
abroad), and at length monte^d my maison in London. I
married Nimrod an artless and beautiful young woman, as
I may now say without vanity, for I have given up all
claims to youth or to personal appearance ; and am now at
the mezzo of the path of nostra vita, as Dante says : having
no pretensions to flirt at all, and leaving that frivolous
amusement to the young girls. I made great sacrifices to
marry Nimrod : I gave up for him Captain (now General)
Flather, the handsomest man of his time, who was ardently
attached to me ; Mr. Pyx, then tutor to the Earl of Noodle-
bury, but now Lord Bishop of Bullocksmithy ; and many
more whom I need not name, and some of whom, I dare
say, have never forgiven me for jilting them, as they call it.
But how could I do otherwise ? Mamma's means were
small. Who could suppose that a captain of dragoons at
Brighton, or a nobleman's tutor and chaplain (who both of
them adored me certainly), would ever rise to their present
eminent positions ? And I therefore sacrificed myself and
my inclinations, as every well-nurtured and highly princi-
pled girl will, and became Mrs. Nimrod — remaining Mrs.
Nimrod — plain Mrs. Nimrod, as Mr. Grimstone said — for
eighteen years. What I suffered no one can tell. Nimrod

has no powers of conversation, and I am all soul and genius.
Nimrod cares neither for poetry, nor for company, nor for
science ; and without geology, without poesy, without so-
ciety, life is a blank to me. Provided he could snooze at
home with the children, poor N. was (and is) happy. But
ah! could their innocent and often foolish conversation
suffice to a woman of my powers ? I was wretchedly de-
ceived, it must be owned, in my marriage, but what mortal
among us has not his or her tracasseries and desillusionne-
ments ? Had I any idea that the old Sir John Nimrod would
have clung to life with such uncommon tenacity, I might
now have been the occupant of the palace of Bullocksmithy
(in place of poor Mrs. Pyx, who is a vulgar creature), and
not the mistress of my house in Eaton Crescent, and of
Hornby Hall, Cumberland, where poor Sir Charles Nimrod
generally lives, shut up with his gout and his children.

He does not come up to London, nor is he fait pour y
hriller. My eldest daughter is amiable, but she has such
frightful red hair that I really could not bring her into the
world ; the boys are with their tutor and at Eton ; and as I
was born for society, I am bound to seek for it alone. I
pass eight months in London, and the remainder at Baden,
or at Brighton, or at Paris. We receive company at Hornby
for a fortnight when I go. Sir C N does not trou-
ble himself much with London or mon monde. He moves
about my saloons without a word to say for himself ; he
asked me whether Dr. Buckland was a poet, whether Sir
Sidney Smith was not an Admiral ; he generally overeats
and drinks himself at the house-dinners of his clubs, being
a member of both Snooker's and Toodle's, and returns home
after six weeks to his stupid Cumberland solitudes. Thus
it will be seen that my lot in life as a domestic character is
not a happy one. Born to hriller in society, I had the honor
of singing on the table at Brighton before the epicure
George the Fourth at six years of age.* What was the use

of shining under such a bushel as poor dear Sir C

N ? There are some of us gifted but unfortunate

beings whose lot is the world. We are like the Wanderer
in my dear friend Eugene Sue's elegant novel, to whom fate
says, " Marche, marche " ; for us pilgrims of society there
is no rest. The Bellairs have been a fated race : dear-
est Mamma dropped down in the tea-rooms at Almack's, and

* It was not before Greorge the Fourth, but before the Prince of Wales,
that Lady Nimrod, then Miss Bellairs, performed at the Pavilion.



THE LION HUNTRESS OF BELGRAVIA. 343

was carried home paralyzed ; I have heard that Papa (be-
fore our misfortunes, and when he lived at Castle Bellairs,
and in Kutland Square) never dined alone for twenty-seven
years and three-quarters, and rather than be without com-
pany he would sit and laugh and quaff with the horrid bail-
iffs who often arrested him.

I am a creature of the world, then ; I cannot help my
nature. The eagle (the crest of the Bellairs) flies to the
dazzling sun, while the "moping owl" prefers the stupid
darkness of the thicket.

They call me the Lion Huntress. I own that I love the
society of the distinguished and the great. A mere culti-
vator of frivolous fashion, a mere toady of the great, I de-
spise ; but genius, but poetry, but talent, but scientific repu-
tation, but humor, but eccentricity above all, I adore. I
have opened my salons now for several seasons. Everybody
of note who has been in our metropolis I have received, —
the great painters, the great poets and sculptors (dear dear
sculptors, I adore them !), the great musicians and artists,
the great statesmen of all the great countries, the great
envoys, the great missionaries, the great generals, the great
everybodies, have honored the reunions of Clementina Nim-
rod. I have had at the same dinner the wise and famous
Monsieur Doctrinaire (and was in hopes he would have
come to me in the footman's suit in which he escaped from
Paris ; but he only came with his Golden Fleece, his broad
ribbon of the Legion of Honor, and eighteen orders), Sig-
nor Bombardi the Koman tribune, General Prince Euba-
dubsti the Russian General, and dear Tarboosh Pasha, who
was converted to Islamism after his heroic conduct in Hun-
gary. I have had Monsieur Sansgene, the eminent socialist
refugee; Rabbi Jehoshaphat, from Jerusalem; the Arch-
bishop of Mealypotatoes, in partibus infidelium, and in pur-
ple stockings ; Brother Higgs, the Mormon Prophet ; and
my own dear Bishop of Bullocksmithy, who has one of the
prettiest ankles and the softest hands in England, seated
round my lowly board. I have had that darling Colonel
Milstone Reid, the decipherer of the Babylonish inscrip-
tions ; the eminent Professor Hodwinck, of Halle, author of
those extraordinary " Horse Antediluvianae," and " The His-
tory of the Three Hundred First Sovereigns of the Fourth
Preadamite Period;" and Professor Blenkinhom (who
reads your handwriting in that wonderful way, you know,
for thirteen stamps) round one tea-table in one room in my



344 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

house. I have had the hero of Acre, the hero of Long
Acre, and a near relation of Greenacre at the same soiree ;
and I am not ashamed to own, that when during his trial
the late atrocious Mr. Kawhead, confiding in his acquittal,
wrote to order a rump and dozen at the inn, I was so much
deceived by the barefaced wretch's protestations of inno-
cence, that I sent him a little note, requesting the honor of
his company at an evening party at my house. He was
found justly guilty of the murder of Mrs. Tripes, was
hanged, and of course could not come to my party. But
had he been innocent, what shame would there have been
in my receiving a man so certainly remarkable, and whose
undoubted courage (had it been exerted in a better cause)
might have led him to do great things ? Yes, and if I
take that villa at Fulham next year, I hope to have a snug
Sunday party from the Agapemone for a game at hockey ;
when I hope that my dear Bishop of Bullocksmithy will
come.

Indeed what is there in life worth living for but the en-
joyment of the society of men of talent and celebrity ? Of
the mere monde, you know, one person is just like another.
Lady A. and Lady B. have their dresses made by the same
milliner, and talk to the same pattern. Lord C.'s whis-
kers are exactly like Mr. D.'s, and their coats are the same,
and their plaited shirt-fronts are the same, and they talk
about the same things. K one dines with JE., or F., or G.,
or H., one has the same dinner at each table ; the very
same soup, entrees^ sweets, and ices, interspersed with the
same conversation carried round in an undertone. If one
goes to I. House or K. House, there is the same music —
the same Mario and Lablache, the same Lablache and
Mario. As for friends in the world, we know what they
are, stupid frumps and family connections, who are angry
if they are not invited to all one's parties, who know and
tell all one's secrets, who spread all the bad stories about
one that are true, or half -true, or untrue : I make a point,
for my part, to have no friends. I mean, nobody who shall
be on such a confidential footing as that he or she shall pre-
sume to know too much of my affairs, or that I shall myself
be so fond of, that I should miss them were they to be
estranged or to die. One is not made, or one need not be
made, to be uncomfortable in life : one need have no painful
sensations about anybody. And that is why I admire and
am familiar with remarkable people and persons of talent



THE LION HUNTRESS OF BELGRAVIA. 345

only ; because, if they die, or go away, or bore me, I can
get other people of talent or remarkable persons in their
place. For instance, this year it is the Nepaulese Princes,
and Mile. Vandermeer, and the Hippopotamus, one is in-
terested about ; next year it may be the Chinese Ambassa-
dors, or the Pope, or the Duke of Bordeaux, or who knows
who ? This year it is the author of the " Memoriam "
(and a most pleasing poet), or Mr. Gumming, the Lion
Hunter of South Africa, or that dear Prelude ; next year,
of course, there will be somebody else, and some other
poems or delightful works, which will come in ; and of
which there is always a bountiful and most providential
and blessed natural supply with every succeeding season.

And as I now sit calmly, at the end of a well-spent sea-
son, surveying my empty apartments, and thinking of the
many interesting personages who have passed through
them, I cannot but think how wise my course has been, and
I look over the list of my lions with pleasure. Poor Sir

C , in the same way, keeps a game-book, I know, and

puts down the hares and pheasants which he has bagged
in his stupid excursions ; and if that strange and delightful
bearded hunter, Mr. Gumming (who was off for Scotland
just when I went to his charming and terrible Exhibition,
close by us at Knightsbridge, and with an intimate Scotch
mutual acquaintance, who would have introduced me, when
I should have numbered in my Wednesday list and my din-
ner-list one noble lion more) — if Mr. Gumming, I say, keeps
his journal of springboks, and elephants and sea-cows, and
lions and monsters, why should not Glementina Nimrod
be permitted to recur to her little journals of the sporting
season ?

II.

ONTINUALLV

have I been asked,
What is a lion ? A
lion is a man or
woman one must
have at one's par-
ties — I have no
other answer but
that. One has a
man at one's pax-
ties because one
sees him at every-
body else's parties ;
I cannot tell you
why. It is the way
of the world, and
when one is of the
world, one must do
as the world does.

Vulgar people,
and persons not of
the world, nevertheless, have their little parties and their
little great men (the foolish absurd creatures !), and I have
no doubt that at any little lawyer's wife's tea-table in
Bloomsbury, or merchant's heavy mahogany in Portland
Place, our manners are ludicrously imitated, and that these
people show off their lions just as we do. I heard Mr.
Grimstone the other night telling of some people with
whom he had been dining, a kind who are not in society,
and of whom, of course, one has never heard. He said that
their manners were not unlike ours ; that they lived in a
very comfortably furnished house ; that they had entries
from the confectioner's, and that kind of thing ; and that
they had their lions, the absurd creatures, in imitation of
us. Some of these people have a great respect for the peer-
age, and Grimstone says that at this house, which belongs
to a relative of his, they never consider their grand dinners




THE LION HUNTRESS OF BELGRAVIA. 347

complete without poor Lord Muddlehead to take the lady
of the house to dinner. Lord Muddlehead never speaks ;
but drinks unceasingly during dinner-time, and is there,
Grimstone says, that the host may have the pleasure of
calling out in a loud voice, and the hearing of his twenty
guests, " Lord Muddlehead, may I have the honor of taking
wine with your lordship ? "

I am told there are several members of the aristocracy
who let themselves out to be dined, as it were, in this sad
way ; and do not dislike the part of lion which they play in
these inferior houses.

Well then ? — what must we acknowledge ? — that per-
sons not in society imitate us ; and that everybody has his
family circle and its little lion for the time being. With us
it is Nelson come home from winning the battle of Aboukir ;
with others it is Tom Smith who has gained the silver sculls
at the rowing match. With us it is a Foreign Minister, or
a Prince in exile ; with others it may be Master Thomas
who has just come from Cambridge, or Mr. and Mrs. Jones
who have just been on a tour to Paris. Poor creatures !
do not let us be too hard on them ! People may not be
in society — and yet, I dare say, mean very well. I have
found in steamboats on the Rhine, and at tahles-d'' hUe on the
Continent, very well-informed persons, really very agreea-
ble, and well mannered, with whom one could converse very
freely, and get from them much valuable information and
assistance — and who, nevertheless, were not in society at
all. These people one does not, of course, recognize on re-
turning to this country (unless they happen to get into the
world, as occasionally they do) ; but it is surprising how
like us many of them are, and what good imitations of our
manners they give.

For instance, this very Mr. Grimstone — Lady ToUington
took him up, and of course, if Lady ToUington takes up a
man he goes everywhere — four or five years ago in Ger-
many I met him at Wiesbaden ; he gave me up his bedroom,
for the inn was full, and he slept on a billiard-table, I think,
and was very good-natured, amusing, and attentive. He
was not then du monde, and I lost sight of him : for, though
he bowed to me one night at the Opera, I thought it was
best not to encourage him, and my glass would not look his
way. But when once received — difficulties of course van-
ished, and I was delighted to know him.

" Mr. Grimstone ! " I said, " how charmed I am to see



348 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

you among us ! How pleasant you must be, ain't you ? I
see you were at Lady Tollington's and Lady Trumping-
ton's ; and of course you will go everywhere ; and will you
come to my Wednesdays ? "

"It is a great comfort, Lady Nimrod," Grimstone said,
"to be in society at last — and a great privilege. You know
that my relations are low, that my father and mother are
vulgar, and that until I came into the monde I had no idea
what decent manners were, and had never met a gentleman
or a lady before ? "

Poor young man ! Considering his disadvantages, he
really pronounces his A's very decently ; and I watched him
all through dinner-time, and he behaved quite well. Lady
Blinker says he is satirical ; but he seems to me simple and
quiet.

Mr. Grimstone is a lion now. His speech in Parliament
made him talked about. Directly one is talked about, one
is a lion. He is a Eadical; and his principles are, I be-
lieve, horrid. But one must have him to one's parties, as
he goes to Lady Tollington's.

There is nothing which I dislike so much as the illiberal-
ity of some narrow-minded English people, who want to
judge everything by their own standard of morals, and are
squeamish with distinguished foreigners whose manners do
not exactly correspond with their own. Have we any right
to quarrel with a Turkish gentleman because he has three
or four wives ? With an officer of Austrian Hussars, be-
cause, in the course of his painful duties, he has had to in-
flict personal punishment on one or two rebellious Italian
or Hungarian ladies, and whip a few little boys ? Does
anybody cut Dr. Ha^vtry, at Eton, for correcting the boys ?
— my sons, I'm sure, would be the better for a little more.
When the Emperor's aide-de-camp. Count Knoutoff, was in
this country, was he not perfectly well received at Court
and in the very first circles ? It gives one a sort of thrill,
and imparts a piquancy and flavor to a whole party when one
has a lion in it who has hanged twenty-five Polish Colonels,
like Count Knoutoff ; or shot a couple of hundred Carlist
officers before breakfast, like General Garbanzos, than whom
I never met a more mild, accomplished, and elegant man.
I should say he is a man of the most sensitive organization,
that he would shrink from giving pain — he has the pret-
tiest white hand I ever saw, except my dear Bishop's ;
and, besides, in those countries an officer must do his duty.



THE LION HUNTRESS OF BELGRAVIA, 349

These extreme measures, of course, are not what one would
like officers of one's own country to do : but consider the
difference of the education of foreigners ! — and also, it
must be remembered, that if poor dear General Garbanzos
did shoot the Carlists, those horrid Carlists, if they had
caught him, would certainly have shot him.

In the same way about remarkable women who come
among us — their standard of propriety, it must be remem-
bered, is not ours, and it is not for us to judge them. When
that delightful Madame Andria came amongst us (whom
Grimstone calls Polyandria, though her name is Alphonsine),
who ever thought of refusing to receive her ? Count Andria
and her first husband, the Baron de Frump, are the best
friends imaginable ; and I have heard that the Baron was
present at his wife's second marriage, wished her new hus-
band joy with all his heart, and danced with a Royal Prin-
cess at the wedding. It is well known that the Prince
Gregory Ragamoffski, who comes out of Prussian Poland —
(where I hope Miss Hulker, of Lombard Street, leads a
happy life, and finds a couronne fermee a consolation for a
bad odious husband, an uncomfortable hide-and-seek barn
of a palace as it is called, and a hideous part of the country)
— I say it is well known that Ragamoffski was married
before he came to England, and that he made a separation
from his Princess a Vaimable ; and came hither expressly
for an heiress. Who minds these things ? Ragamoffski
was everywhere in London ; and there were Dukes at Saint
George's to sign the register ; and at the breakfast in Hyde
Park Gardens, which old Hulker gave, without inviting me,
by the way. Thence, I say, it ought to be clear to us that
foreigners are to be judged by their own ways and habits,
and not ours — and that idle cry which people make against
some of them for not conforming to our practices ought to
be put down ! Cry out against them, indeed ! Mr. Grim-
stone says, that if the Emperor Nero, having slaughtered half
Christendom the week before, could come to England with
plenty of money in his pocket, all London would welcome
him, and he would be pressed at the very first houses to
play the fiddle — and that if Queen Catherine of Medicis,
though she had roasted all the Huguenots in France, had
come over afterwards to Mivart's, on a visit to Queen Eliza-
beth, the very best nobility in the country would have come
to put their names down in her visiting-book.

AMONG the most considerable lions who have figured
in my menagerie, I may mention Bobbachy Bahawder,
the Prince of Delhi, who came over on a confidential mis-
sion, from his Imperial Majesty the Emperor Aurungzebe,
his august sovereign and master. No soiree was for some
time complete without the Bobbachy. Of all the Orientals
who have visited our shores, it was agreed that he was the
most witty, interesting, and accomplished ; he travelled with
a small suite of Hookabadars, Kitmutgars, and Lascars ; and
the sensation was prodigious which was occasioned by the
intelligence that the distinguished Envoy had it in command
from his Imperial master, to choose out from among the beau-
ties of Britain a young lady who would not object to become
Empress of Delhi in place of the late lamented wife of the
sovereign, for whose loss his Majesty was inconsolable. It
was only after he had been for some time in the country,
that this the real object of his mission transpired ; for, for
some time, the Bobbachy lived in the most private manner,
and he was not even presented at Court, nor asked to a
turtle dinner by the East India Company. In fact, some of
the authorities of Leadenhall Street said that the Bobbachy
was no more an Ambassador than you or I, and hinted he
was an impostor ; but his Excellency's friends knew better,
and that there are differences of such a serious nature be-
tween the East India Company and the Delhi Emperor, that
it was to the interest of the Leadenhall Street potentates to
ignore the Bobbachy, and throw all the discredit which they
could upon the Envoy of the great, widowed, and injured
sovereign.

Lady Lynx took this line, and would not receive him ;
but the manner in which her ladyship is liee with some of
those odious directors, and the way in which she begs, bor-
rows, and, as I believe, sells, the cadetships and writerships
which she gets from them, is very well known. She did
everything malice and envy could suggest to bring this
eminent Asiatic into disrepute ; she said he was not a



THE LION HUNTRESS OF BELGRAVIA, 351

Prince, or an Envoy at all, or anything but a merchant in his
own country ; but as she always tries to sneer at my lions,
and to pooh-pooh my parties, and as I was one of the first
to welcome the distinguished Bobbachy to this country, the
very ill-will and envy of Lady Lynx only made me the more
confident of the quality of this remarkable person ; and I
do not blush to own that I was among the first to welcome
him to our shores. I asked people to meet the Ambassador
of the Emperor of Delhi. That I own, and that he denied
altogether that he was here in any such capacity ; but if
reasons of state prevented him from acknowledging his
rank, that was no reason why we should not award it to
him ; and I was proud to have the chance of presenting his
Excellency to society, in opposition to that stupid uninter-
esting Hungarian General whom Lady Lynx brought out
at the same time, and who, to the best of my belief, was an
Irishman out of Connaught, for he spoke English with a
decided Connemara brogue.

When the Bobbachy first came to this country, he oc-
cupied humble lodgings in Jermyn Street, and lived at no
expense ; but happening to be staying at the Star and Garter
at Eichmond, where he one day came to dinner, I introduced
myself to him in the hotel gardens ; said I was the Lady
Nimrod, one of the chiefs of English society, of whom per-
haps he had heard, and that I should be glad to do any-
thing in my power to make the metropolis welcome for him,
and introduce him into the best company. He put both
his hands before him on his breast, as if he was going to
swim at me, Mr. Grimstone said, and made me a most ele-
gant bow ; answering in very good English that my humble
name and the reputation of my parties had often formed
the subject of conversation at the Court of Delhi and
throughout the East ; and that it was a white day in his
life in which he had the delight to see the countenance
of one who was so illustrious for beauty, as he was pleased
to say I was. " Ah ! " he often said afterwards, " why has
Fate disposed so early of such a lovely creature ? WTiat a
lucky individual is he (meaning Nimrod) who possesses
such a pearl ! It is fit to be worn in an emperor's turban,
and I must not speak about you to my master or show your
portrait to him unless I can take you to him ; for he will
certainly, when I get back to Delhi, chop my head off from
rage and disappointment at my returning home without
you."



352 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS,

This speech, though Oriental, at least shows he was well-
bred. As for my marrying the emperor, that is out of the
question, for Nimrod is alive in the country, and we have
no means of pursuing your Oriental practices of bowstring-
ing here. I told the Bobbachy at once that the emperor
must never think of me, must never be spoken to about
me, and that I must live and die • an English, not an In-
dian lady. But this was in after-times, and when we grew
more intimate together. Meanwhile it gave me great pleas-
ure in introducing into the world this amiable and polite
exotic.

At first, as I have said, he lived in a very humble and
retired manner in Jermyn Street. When I called upon
him in my carriage with my footmen, the door was opened
by a maid of all work, who told us with wonder that " the
Injan gent," as she called him, lived on the second floor. I
toiled up to his apartment (how different to the splendid
halls and alabaster pillars and sparkling fountains of the
palaces of his native East !) and there found his Excellency
on a horsehair sofa, smoking his hookah. I insisted upon
taking him a drive into the Park. It happened to be a fine
day, and there was a throng of carriages, and most eyes
were directed towards the noble stranger, as he sat by my
side in the carriage in a simple Oriental costume with a
turban of red and gold. I would have taken the back seat
and have let him sit cross-legged, but I had Miss Higgs,
my companion, and Fido on the back seat. I mentioned
everywhere who he was, took him to the Opera that night,
and had him at my Wednesday, with a petit diner choisi to
meet him.

He had not been at Court as yet, nor with the East India
Company, for the reasons I have stated. Until the presents
for her Majesty, with which the "Burrumpooter" East
Indiaman was loaded, had reached London — presents con-
sisting of the most valuable diamonds, shawls, elephants,
and other choice specimens of Oriental splendor — had
arrived in the East India Docks, it was not etiquette for
him to present himself before the sovereign of this country.
Hence his quiet retreat in his Jermyn Street lodgings ; and
he laughed at the audacity of the landlord of the odious
house. " Landlord," he said, " he think me rogue. Land-
lord he send me bill. Landlord he think Bobbachy Ba-
hawder not pay. Stop till ' Burrumpooter ' come, then see
whether landlord not go down on his knee before the Em-



THE LION HUNTRESS OF BELGRAVIA. 863

peror's Ambassador." Indeed his Excellency had arrived
with only two attendants, by the steamer and the overland
route, leaving the bulk of his suite and the invaluable bag-
gage to follow in the " Burrumpooter."

He was a fine judge of diamonds and shawls, of course,
and very curious about the jewellers and shawl merchants
of London. I took him in my carriage to one or two of
our principal tradesmen ; but there was very little which he
admired, having seen much finer brilliants and shawls in
his own romantic land.

When he saw my house he was delighted and surprised.
He said he thought all houses in London like that lodging
in Jermyn Street — all sofas black, all sky black: why his
dam secretary take him to that black hole ? Landlord —
dam secretary's uncle — charge him hundred pound month
for that lodging. I represented how atrociously his Excel-
lency had been imposed upon, and that if he intended to
receive company, he should certainly transport himself to
better apartments. It is wonderful how these simple for-
eigners are imposed upon by our grasping countrymen !

The Bobbachy took my advice, and removed to handsome
rooms at Green's Hotel, where he engaged a larger suite,
and began to give entertainments more befitting his rank.
He brought a native cook, who prepared the most delicious
curries, pillaws, and Indian dishes, which really made one
cry — they were so hot with pepper. He gradually got
about him a number of the most distinguished people, and,
thanks to my introduction and his own elegant and capti-
vating manners, was received at many of our best houses ;
and when the real object of his mission came out (which he
revealed to me in confidence), that he was anxious to select
a lady for the vacant throne of Delhi, it was wonderful how
popular he became, and how anxious people were about
him. The portrait of his Imperial master, the emperor,
seated on a gold throne, was hung up in his principal draw-
ing-room ; and though a vile daub, as most people said,
especially that envious Grimstone, who said he must have
bought it of some Strand limjier for a guinea — yet what
can one expect from an Indian artist ? and the picture rep-
resented a handsome young man, with a sweet black beard,
a thin waist, and a necklace of diamonds worth millions
and billions of rupees.

If the young ladies and mammas of London flocked to
see this picture, you may imagine how eager the mammas

and young ladies were to show their own beauties ! Every-
body read up about Delhi, and was so anxious to know about
it from his Excellency ! Mrs. Cramley, hearing that the
Orientals like stout ladies, sent to Scotland for that enor-
mous Miss Cramley, who is obliged to live in seclusion on
account of her size, and who really would do for a show.
Old Lady Glum said if she allowed her daughter to make
such a marriage, it would be with the fervent hope of con-
verting the emperor and all India with him. Little Miss
Cockshaw was anxious to know if the widows were burned
still at Delhi. I don't know how many women didn't ask
his Excellency when this news was made public, and my
lion was nearly torn to pieces. It was " Bobbachy Bahawder
and suite," " His Excellency Bobbachy Bahawder," " His
Excellency Prince Bobbachy Bahawder," everywhere now,
his name in all the newspapers, and who should be most
eager to receive him.

The number of pictures of young ladies of rank which my
friend received from all parts of the country would have
formed a series of Books of Beauty. There came portraits
from Belgravia — portraits from Tyburnia — portraits from
the country ; portraits even from Bloomsbury and the City,
when the news was made public of the nature of his Excel-
lency's mission. Such wicked deceptive portraits they sent
up too ! Old Miss Cruickshanks had herself painted like
a sylph or an opera dancer; Mrs. Bibb, who is five-and-
forty if she's a day old, went to a great expense, and had
a fashionable painter to draw her in a crop and a pinafore,
like a schoolgirl. Fathers brought their children to walk
up and down before his Excellency's hotel, and some bribed
his Excellency's secretary to be allowed to wait in the ante-
room until he should pass out from breakfast. That Lady
Lynx said that the only ready money which the mission
got was from these bribes ; and the pictures, I must con-
fess, were sold upon the Minister's withdrawal from this
country.

A sudden revolution at the Court of Delhi occurred, as is
very well known, in May last, and the news of his recall
was brought to my excellent friend. The demand for his
return was so peremptory, that he was obliged to quit Eng-
land at a moment's notice, and departed with his secretary
only, and before he had even had time to take leave of me,
his most attached friend.

A lamentable accident must have happened to the " Bur-



THE LION HUNTRESS OF BELGRAVIA. 355

rumpooter" Indiaman, with the diamonds and elephants
on board, for the unfortunate ship has never reached Eng-
land, and I dare say has sunk with all on board.

But that is no reason for the slander of ill-natured people,
who want to make the world believe that there never was
such a ship as the " Burrumpooter " at all ; and that the
Bobbachy and his secretary were a couple of rogues in
league together, who never had a penny, and never would
have made their way in society but for my introduction.
How am I to know the pedigrees of Indian princes, and the
manners of one blackamoor from another ? If I introduced
the Bobbachy, I'm sure other people have introduced other
dark-complexioned people ; and as for the impudence of
those tradesmen who want me to pay his bills, and of Mr.
Green, of the hotel, who says he never had a shilling of his
Excellency's money, I've no words to speak of it.

Besides, I don't believe he has defrauded anybody ; and
when the differences at the Court of Delhi are adjusted,
I've little doubt but that he will send the paltry few thou-
sand pounds he owes here, and perhaps come back to renew
the negotiations for the marriage of his Imperial master.

I canH help it. My mamma had a fright before I was born,
and that^s what it is, I suppose.

Sir, I am very miserable at school with everybody lick-

the idear of it altogether. Why was schools ever invented ?
When I'm at my dear home, with dear Ma and sisters, and in
bed as long as I choose, and wish twice to meat, or three
times, if I like ; and I walk in the Park, and go to see a
lovely Pantamime ; and so I lose the horrid thought of
school ; and it's only in my dreams, sometimes, I see that
abommanable old Doctor.

What I want you to do in the interest of all School Boys,
is to stop the Times in holy time from publishing those ad-
vertisements about schools. On this day, Wednesday, jest
against the leading article, there's no less than 2 columns
of schools ; and Papa, who's always jokin' and chaffin' me,
reads 'em out, and says, " Tom, how'd you like this ? —
Education of a superior kind, Birchwood Briars. No extras,
no holidays." Or, " Tom, here's a chance for you — To

establishment the Son of a respectable Laundress, on recip-

Ma, " what a pity you wasn't a washerwoman, and we could
get this stupid boy educated for nothing." I'm sure I've
been mangled enough by that bully Bob Cuff, if I haven't
been ironed and hung up to dry ! Or, " To Booksellers,

our sheep, whether the Doctor would take them in payment
of the quarter's account ? And then he says that one calf
ought to pay for another, and laughs and makes me miser-
able for the whole day.

A STRANGE DISCOVERY IN GERMAN^.



STEiNGE MAN JUST DISCOVERED IN GER-
MANY.



T has been mentioned in
the German jomnala that
a foreigner, from some
unknown country, and
speaking a jargon scarcely
intelligible by the most
profound German philolo-
gists, has lately made his
appearance at Frankfort-
on - the - Oder, where of
course he wa^ banded
over to the care of the
police.

" This individual was
brought before ue, Johann
Humpffenstrumpffen,
Burgomaster of Frankfort,
on Tuesday, the 8th of
April, and examined in
our presence and that of
our Clerk and Town Council.

" The raiment and appearance of this individual, landed,
no one knows how, in a remote and extremely quiet Ger-
man city, are described by all persons as most singular.
In height he is about five feet six inches, his hair is white,
his face sallow, his beard red — that on his upper lip not
so much grown as that on his cheeks ; his hands are large
and dirty, hia teeth useful, his appetite great, and hia thirst
constant.

" Hia dresa is most extraordinary and barbarous. On Ms
head he wears a covering of a snufE-brown color, in shape
something like a wash-baain — which it would be very ad-




360 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS,

visable that he should use for his face and hands. Round
his neck, which is exceedingly ugly and bare, he wears a
strip of a shining stuff, spun out of worms, he says, in his
own country, and called an Alberti ; it is puffed in two
bows round his cheeks, and gives him a highly absurd ap-
pearance.

"His outer garment was a loose shaggy vest, made out
of the skin of bears, most likely, and tainted strongly with
a stale and exceedingly rancorous odor of what he calls

* backy-backy.' This outer dress — when asked its name by
Burgermeister von Humpffenstrumpffen — the nondescript
called a * Minorimosy ; ' and holding up his outstretched
hand three times, cried out the syllable ' Bob,' and wagged
his head; from which the Burgomaster concluded that

* bob ' is the name of a coin of the country.

" His next garment, one without sleeves, was decorated
with buttons of glass ; and in the pockets were found bits
of paper, which the nondescript tried to explain — by the
words * ungle,' ' tickor,' ^ spowt,' etc. — and showed by his
gestures that the papers were to him of considerable value.
They are greasy, and, to all appearances, worthless, coarsely
printed, and marked with rude manuscript numerals. It is
conjectured that they may form part of the paper-money of
his country.

" Beyond these tokens, no coin of any kind was found
on the nondescript's person.

" Under the glass-buttoned garment, from which he
struggled violently not to be divested, the stranger had on
two other very singular articles of costume. One was very
ragged, and evidently old, and covered with printed figures
in pink, representing bayaderes dancing. Over this was a
small piece of stuff worked with the needle, and once white
— the name of which, after repeated and severe interroga-
tories, he said was 'Dicki.' It has been carried to the
Museum, and placed between the breastplate of a Turkish
vizier and a corselet of a knight of the middle ages.

" His lower dress was of a broad check pattern, some-
thing resembling the stuff which is worn by the Scottish
Highlanders, who, however, it is known, do not use braccce,
whence it is evident that the stranger cannot be one of
these. When the Burgomaster pointed to these, the non-
descript wagged his head, pleased seemingly, and said the
word * Stunnin,' which the clerk took down.

" On his feet were a sort of short boot with large iron



A STRANGE DISCOVERY IN GERMANY. 861

heels, in which he began to execute a queer dance before the
Court, clinking the heels together, and turning the toes fan-
tastically in and out. Pointing to this boot with the cane
which he carries in his mouth, he winked to the clerk, and
said ^ Hylo ! ' but then presently looking round the room,
and seeing a portrait of the late Feldmarschall Prince of
Wallstadt, he ran up to it and said, ' Blooker ! Blooker ! '
and danced once more.

" What relation can there be between the nondescript's
boot and the late gallant and venerated Marshal Forwards,
who destroyed Bonaparte, after the latter had defeated and
taken the Herzog v. Wellington prisoner at the battle of
Mount Saint John ?

"At this stage of the examination, and having been
allowed to resume all his clothes, the stranger pointed to
his mouth, and laid his hand on his stomach, crying out the
monosyllable * Grub,' which Doctor Blinkhorn thinks must
mean food in his language. Accordingly, a sausage, some
bread, and a can of beer were brought, of the first of which
he partook greedily, devouring the whole bread and sausage.
It was observed that he ate with his fork, not with his
knife, as we Germans do.

"Having tasted the drink, he, however, laid it down,
making very wry faces, and calling out the word * Swipey,
Swipey,' twice, which was taken down. And then, by more
faces and contortions, he made us to understand as if the
beer had disagreed with him, upon which the excellent
Burgermeister, having a bottle of Ehum in' the cupboard,
gave the savage a glass, who smacked it off at once, crying
out the word ^ Jollybyjingo.'

" * Jollybijingo, was ist denn JoUybijingo ? ' asked his
Worship, conjecturing, with his usual acuteness, that this
was the savage's phrase for Rhum of Jamaica. * Wilt thou
have yet a glass Jollybijingo ? ' And his honor poured
out a second glass, which the nondescript seized and tossed
off, this time exclaiming :

" ^ Aybaleaveyermibawawawy ! '

"Which expression being accurately taken down, his
worship the Burgermeister considered the examination suf-
ficient, and sent off the Foreigner under the guard of Gen-
darmes Blitz and Wetter to Berlin.

" A true copy.

WHAT I EEMARKED AT THE EXHIBITION.

1861.

IREMAEKED that the scene I witnessed was the
grandest and most cheerful, the brightest and most
splendid show that eyes had ever looked on since the crea-
tion of the world ; — but as everybody remarked the same
thing, this remark is not of much value.

I remarked, and with a feeling of shame, that I had long
hesitated about paying three guineas — pooh-poohed — said
I had seen the Queen and Prince before, and so forth, and
felt now that to behold this spectacle, three guineas, or five
guineas, or any sum of money (for I am a man of enormous
wealth) would have been cheap ; and I remarked how few
of us know really what is good for us — have the courage
of our situations, and what a number of chances in life we
throw away. I would not part with the mere recollection
of. this scene for a small annuity ; and calculate that, after
paying my three guineas, I have the Exhibition before me,
besides being largely and actually in pocket.

I remarked that a heavy packet of sandwiches which
Jones begged me to carry, and which I pocketed in rather
a supercilious and grumbling manner, became most pleasant
friends and useful companions after we had been in our
places two or three hours ; and I thought to myself, that
were I a lyric poet with a moral turn, I would remark how
often in the hour of our need our humble friends are wel-
come and useful to us, like those dear sandwiches, which we
pooh-poohed when we did not need them.

I remarked that when the Queen bowed and curtseyed,
all the women about began to cry.

I remarked how eagerly the young Prince talked with his
sister — how charmed everybody was to see those pretty
young persons walking hand in hand with their father and
mother, and how, in the midst of any magnificence you will,
what touches us most is nature and human kindness, and
what we love to witness most is love.



364 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS,

I remarked three Roman Catholic clergymen in the midst
of the crowd, amusing themselves with an opera-glass.

I remarked to myself that it was remarkable tl^t a priest
should have an opera-glass.

I remarked that when the Archbishop of Canterbury was
saying his prayer, the Roman Catholic clergymen seemed
no more to care than I should if Mr. Longears was speaking
in the House of Commons — and that they looked, stared,
peered over people's shoulders, and used the opera-glass
during the prayer.

I remarked that it would have been more decorous if,
during that part of the day's proceedings, the reverend
gentlemen had not used the opera-glass.

I remarked that I couldn't be paying much attention
myself, else how should I have seen the reverend gentle-
men?

I remarked my Lord Ivorystick and my Lord Ebonystick
backing all the way round the immense building before the
Queen ; and I wondered to myself how long is that sort of
business going to last ? how long will freeborn men forsake
the natural manner of walking, with which God endowed
them, and continue to execute this strange and barbarous
pas ? I remarked that a royal Chamberlain was no more
made to walk backwards, than a royal coachman to sit on
the box and drive backwards. And having just been laugh-
ing at the kotoos of honest Lord Chopstick (the Chinese
Ambassador with the pantomime face), most of us in our
gallery remarked that the performance of Lord Ivorystick
and Lord Ebonystick was not more reasonable than that of
his Excellency Chopstick, and wished that part of the cere-
mony had been left out.

I remarked in the gold cage, to which the ladies would
go the first thing, and in which the Koh-i-noor reposes, a
shining thing like a lambent oyster, which I admired greatly,
and took to be the famous jewel. But on a second visit I
was told that that was not the jewel — that was only the
case, and the real stone was that above, which I had taken
to be an imitation in crystal.

I remarked on this, that there are many sham diamonds
in this life which pass for real, and, ^nce versd, many real
diamonds which go unvalued. This accounts for the non-
success of those real mountains of light, my " Sonnets on
Various Occasions."

I remarked that, if I were Queen of England, I would



WHAT I REMARKED AT THE EXHIBITION. 365

have a piece of this crystal set into my crown, and wear it
as the most splendid jewel of the whole diadem — that I
would.

And in fact I remarked altogether — God save the
Queen !

M. GOBEMOUCHE'S AUTHENTIC ACCOUNT OF
THE GRAND EXHIBITION.



bhe



1851.

N the good town of London, in the Squars, in the
Coffees, in the Parks, in the society at the billiards,
tEere is but one conversation — it is of the Palace of In-
dustry ; it is of the Queen and Prince Albert ; it is of the
union of all nations. " Have you been there, my friend ? ''
every one says to every one.

Yes, I have been there. Yes, I am one of the myriads
who visited the Palace of Industry on the first of May, and
witnessed the triumph of France.

Early in the day, following in the track of the myriads
who were rushing towards the romantic village of Kinsington,
and through the Bridge of Chevaliers, I engaged a cabriolet
of place, and bidding the driver conduct me to the Palace of
all Nations at Kinsington, sat in profound reverie smoking
my cigar and thinking of France, until my driver paused,
and the agglomeration of the multitude, and the appearance
of the inevitable Poliseman of London, sufficiently informed
us that we were at the entrance of the Industrial Palace.

Polisemen flank the left pillar of the gate surmounted
by a vase, emblem of plenty ; polisemen flank the right
pillar decorated by a lion (this eternal Britannic lion, how
his roars fatigue me ; his tail does not frighten me ; his
eternal fanfaronnades regarding his courage makes me puff
of to laugh !) — and as nothing is to be seen in England
without undoing purse, a man at a wicket stops the influx
of the curious, and the tide cannot pass the barrier except
through the filter of a schilling.

cursed schilling ! He haunts me, that schilling. He
pursues me everywhere. If a Frenchman has to produce
his passport, there is no moment of the day when an Eng-
lishman must not produce his schilling. I paid that sum,
and was with others admitted into the barrier, and to pass
the outer wall of the Great Exhibition.

When one enters, the sight that at first presents itself
has nothing of remarkable — a court, two pavilions on either
side, a chateau, to the door of which you approach by steps
of no particular height or grandeur : these were the simple
arrangements which it appears that the Britannic genius
has invented for the reception of all people of the globe.

I knock in the English fashion — the simple baronnet
gives but one knock ; the postman, officer of the Govern-

coats, it being spring-time, covered with a multiplicity of
buds — fling open the two beatings of the door, and I enter
the little ante-hall.

I look up — above me is an azure dome like the vault
ethereal, silver stars twinkle in its abysses, a left-hand
lancing thunderbolt is above us — I read above, in char-
acters resembling the lightning — '^ Fille de Vorage^^ in
our own language, and "Symbolium of all Nations" in
English.

Is the daughter of the tempest then the symbol of all
nations ? Is the day's quiet the lull after yesterday's
storm ? Profound moralist, yes — it is so — we enter into
repose through the initiation of the hurricane — we pass
over the breakers and are in the haven !

This pretty moral conveyed in the French language, the
world's language, as a prelude to the entertainment — this
solemn antechamber to the Palace of the World, struck me
as appropriate as sublime. With a beating heart I ascend
further steps — I am in the world's vestibule.

What do I see around me ? Another magnificent alle-
gory. The cities of the world are giving each other the
hand — the Tower of Pisa nods friendly to the Wall of
China — the Pont Neuf and the Bridge of Sighs meet and
mingle arches — Saint Paul, of London, is of accord with
his brother Saint Peter of Kome — and the Parthenon is
united with the Luqsor Obelisk, joining its civilization to
the Egyptian mysteries, as the Greek philosophers trav-
elled to Egypt of old ; — a great idea this — greatly worked
out, in an art purposely naive, in a design expressly con-
fused.

From this vestibule I see a staircase ascending, em-

blazoned with the magic hieroglyphics, and strange alle-
goric images. In everything that the Briton does lurks a
deep meaning — the vices of his nobility, the quarrels of
his priests, the peculiarities of his authors, are here drama-
tized : — a Pope, a Cardinal appear among fantastic devils
— the romancers of the day figure with their attributes —
the statesmen of the three kingdoms with their various
systems — fiends, dragons, monsters, curl and writhe
through the multitudinous hieroglyphic, and typify the
fate that perhaps menaces the venomous enemies that
empoison the country.

The chambers of this marvellous Palace are decorated
in various styles, each dedicated to a nation. One room
flames in crimson and yellow, surmounted by a vast golden
sun, which you see, in regarding it, must be the chamber
of the East. Another, decorated with stalactites and piled
with looking-glass and eternal snow, at once suggests Kam-
schatka or the North Pole. In a third apartment, the
Chinese dragons and lanterns display their fantastic blar
zons ; while in a fourth, under a canopy of midnight stars,
surrounded by waving palm-trees, we feel ourselves at once
to be in a primeval forest of Brazil, or else in a scene of
fairy — I know not which ; — the eye is dazzled, the brain
is feverous, in beholding so much of wonders.

Faithful to their national economy, of what, think you,
are the decorations of the Palace ? — Of calico ! — Calico in
the emblematic halls. Calico in the Pompadour boudoirs.
Calico in the Chamber of the Sun — Calico everywhere.
Indeed, whither have not the English pushed their cot-
tons ? their commerce ? Calico has been the baleful cause
of their foreign wars, their interior commotions. Calico has
been the source of their wealth, of their present triumphant
condition, perhaps of their future downfall ! Well and
deeply the decorators of the Palace meditated when they
decorated its walls with this British manufacture.

Descending, as from a vessel's deck, we approach a fairy
park, in which the works of art bud and bloom beside the
lovely trees of Spring. What green pelouses are here !
what waving poplars ! what alleys shaded by the buds and
blossoms of Spring ! Here are parterres blooming with
polyanthuses and colored lamps ; a fountain there where
Numa might have wooed Egeria. Statues rise gleaming
from the meadow ; Apollo bends his bow ; Dorothea washes
her fair feet ; Esmeralda sports with her kid. What know

I ? How select a beauty where all are beautiful ? how
specify a wonder where all is miracle ?

In yon long and unadorned arbor, it has been arranged
by the English (who never do anything without rosbif and
half-and-half) that the nations of the world are to feast.
And that vast building situated on the eastern side of the
pelouse, with battlemented walls and transparent roof, is
the much-vaunted Palace of Crystal ! Yes ; the roof is of
crystal, the dimensions are vast, — only the articles to be
exhibited have not been unpacked yet ; the walls of the
Palace of Crystal are bare.

" That is the Baronial Hall of all Nations," says a gentle-
man to me — a gentleman in a flowing robe and a singular
cap whom I had mistaken for a Chinese or an enchanter.
" The hall is not open yet, but it will be inaugurated by the
grand Sanitaiy dinner. There will be half-crown dinners
for the commonalty, five-shilling dinners for those of medi-
ocre fortune, ten-shilling dinners for gentlemen of fashion
like Monsieur. Monsieur, I have the honor to salute you."
— And he passes on to greet another group.

I muse, I pause, I meditate. Where have I seen that
face ? Where noted that mien, that cap ? Ah, I have it !
In the books devoted to gastronomic regeneration, on the
flasks of sauce called Relish. This is not the Crystal
Palace that I see, — this is the rival wonder — yes, this is
the Symposium of all Nations, and yonder man is Alexis

THE CHARLES THE SECOND BALL.

18S1.

INCE the annoTincement of
the Costume Ball a good
deal of excitement has been
prevalent about the Court
regarding it. It is known
that Charles the Second
used to feed ducks in Saint
James's Park, and it is
thought that thia amuse-
ment of the Merry Mon-
arch is harmless, and may
be repeated oo tie present
festive occasion. Rewards
have been offered at the
Lord Chamberlain's Office
for a means of keeping the
ducks awake till twelve
o'clock at night.

We hear that some Duch-
esses decline altogether to
assume the character of
their namesakes in the time
of Charles the Second ; and
that the Dukes, their hus-
bands, perfectly agree in
this spirited decision.
For the same reason as
their Graces', the parts of Maids of Honor are not in much
request. But for the character of Catherine Hyde, who
married the heir to the throne, there are numberless propo-
sals among the young ladies of the polite world.

For the character of the Duke of Buckingham (of Charles
the Second's time), who kicked down a grand fortune with-
out being able to account for it, we hear a great number of




THE CHARLES THE SECOND BALL, 871

noblemen named; among others, Lord Addlestone, Lord
Muddlehead, and the Lord Viscount Wildgoose.

The young gentlemen about Downing Street are reading
the "Biographie Universelle/' and acquiring a surprising
fund of historical knowledge. Young Tapely, old Tapely's
son, who is eighteen, and has just entered the Foreign
Office, proposes to appear as Colbert : whom Guttleton ad-
mires, not as a Minister, but as inventor of Colbert soles.
Van der Souchey, of the Dutch Legation, announced at the
Club that he would go as the Pensionary de Witt. " Be-
hold de miracle instead of de witt," said Flicflac ; and
added, that Count Narcissi (the envoy from Pumpernickel)
had best assume this character, because the women are
always tearing him to pieces.

General the Earl of Slowgo (who does his best to be an
F. M.) has just been credibly informed that a work exists —
a remarkable work — although a light work he may almost
say a biographical work — relative to the times of Charles
the Second, called " Pepys' Diary," and purporting to be
edited by a member of their lordships' House, the Lord Vis-
count Braybrooke.

General Slowgo has, therefore, presented his compliments
to Lord Viscount Braybrooke, and requests to know if the
Viscount has edited the work in question? Should his
lordship's reply be in the affirmative. General Lord Slowgo
will write to the Librarian of the British Museum, to
know ; 1st. Whether the work entitled " Pepys' Memoirs "
be in the Library of the British Museum ? 2d. Whether
that work contains an authentic account of the reign of his
late Majesty King Charles the Second ? 3d. Whether the
Librarian of the British Museum can bring the volume, if a
rare one, to Slowgo House? And, 4th. If not, whether,
and at what time, General the Earl of Slowgo can consult
the work in question at the British Museum ?

The two little Miss Budds (who go about with Lady
Crabb) have had another contemporary work lent to them
by their cousin Eowley, and are busy reading Grammont's
" Memoirs." When Lady Crabb heard that her wards were
reading history, she was highly pleased, and observed that
she has no doubt the volume is instructive, as the family
of Grammont is one of the highest in France. The Miss
Budds say the book is — very instructive.

Miss Grigg, who is exceedingly curious in books and an-
tiquarianism, has come upon some surprising illustrative

passages in her papa's library, in the works of Wycherley
and Sir C. Sedley, and in Suckling's poems.

Colonel Sir Nigel M'Asser, who has the largest and
blackest whiskers not only in the Horse Guards Green, but

gdth the exception of one sapper, now at the Cape of Good
ope) in the British Army, when he heard that whiskers
were not worn in the time of Charles the Second, and that
gentlemen would be expected to shave, instantly applied
for leave of absence ; and, if that is refused, he will send in
his papers.

Lady Rosa Twentystone and her daughters have been to
Hampton Court, and taken careful note of the Lelys there.
But when they came down to dinner in the dresses which
they had prepared, and rehearsed the part before Mr.
Twentystone, he ordered the whole family up to their
rooms, and the dinner to be covered, until they were.

" Lady Rosa is so delightful," Varges says, that he thinks
one " can't see too much of her."

Lord Viscount Methuselah has put himself into the
hands of new artists, and will appear with the cheeks, hair,
and teeth of twenty. He has selected the character of Lord
Rochester, and has sent a request to the Lord Chamberlain
that he may be allowed to make his entree into the ball
through a window and up a rope-ladder.

Lord Hulkington hopes to be able to get into a page's
dress which he wore once in private theatricals at the
Princess of Wales's Court at Naples in 1814 ; and the ladies
of his family are busy (for his lordship, since he came into
his fortune, is become very economical) in trying to en-
large it.

Lady Howlbury expects to make a great sensation, and
not at a large expense ; having attired hei^self and daugh-
ters each in a curtain of the State bed at Ivybush, under
which Charles the Second passed three days after the battle
of Worcester.

If the Lord Mayor is invited with his suite, the City
Marshal, of course, will go as Marshal Tureen.

Lord Tom Noddington was much surprised when he
heard that Charles the Second had been up a tree, and al-
ways thought that he ran for the Oaks. His opinion was
that Charles the Second had had his head cut off, just be-
fore his son, James the First, came into this country, from
Scotland — where Lord Tom goes shooting every year.
Mr. Bland Varges, who is the most notorious wag at



THE CHARLES THE SECOND BALL. 878

Spratt's, said that as Tom Noddington had no head himself,
he had better go as the Marquis of Montrose — after his
decapitation. Tom Noddington said he would be hanged if
he went as Montrose, which Varges said was more and more
in character. Lord Tom said he didn't know. He knew
that he had shot the Duke's country, and hoped to shoot
there again; and he thought ^^it was devilish dangerous,
begad, in those confounded levelling times, by Jove, for
f eUas to go about saying that other fellas had their heads
cut off ; and that sort of thing, begad, might put bad ideas
into other fellas' heads, and radical fellas, and dam repub-
lican fellas." Mr. Varges said that Lord Tom needn't be
afraid about his head, and that if he lost it he wouldn't
miss it ; on which Tom Noddy said that Varges was always
chaffing him.

Lord Addlestone — when his librarian informed him he
had heard that Louis the Fourteenth as a young man wore
a periwig powdered with gold-dust — has hit upon a bril-
liant thought of his own, and ordered that his wig shall not
only be powdered with gold, but that he will have a papil-
late of bank-notes.

If these are scarce, as his steward informs him, his lord-
ship's man is directed to use promissory notes bearing his
lordship's valuable signature.

The young officers of the Eclectic Regiments, horse and
foot, Comets and Lieutenant-Captains with ten shillings per
diem of pay, are greatly gratified at the idea of having to
pay forty pounds a piece for their wigs at the Ball.

It is said that a venerable Prelate of a Western Diocese
is going to represent all the seven recusant Bishops of
James's time at once ; and Cardinal de Retz, who had a
genius for conspiracies, fights, rows, and hot water in gen-
eral, has a representative in Golden Square, with a hat and
costume ready bought and paid for.

Ensign and Lieutenant Tipton, of the Coolstreams, says
that he intends to take Marlborough's part as a young man,
for he is very good-looking, is as poor as a rat, and ready to
borrow money of any woman who will lend it.

PANORAMA OF THE INGLEEZ.

(From the " Beyrout Banner" ** Joppa Intelligencer,^^ and "Jerusalem

Journal")

1851.

THE renowned and learned Sage and Doctor of Bey-
rout, the excellent Hadjee Aboo Bosh, has just re-
turned to his beloved country from his wonderful travels in
distant lands, having visited most of the cities and people
of Franghistan. He is familiar with all languages, and has
deeply studied the customs and manners of the Infidels.
He has caused skilful limners amongst them, at the expense
of many millions of piastres, to paint pictures representing
the chief towns of the Franks ; which works are so wonder-
ful, lifelike, and resembling nature, that true Believers,
without leaving the cushion of repose, or the pipe of medi-
tation, may behold the towns of Europe presented before
them, and have the mountains to come to them which would
not advance in former ages, no, not even to meet the
Prophet.

The famous and skilful Hadjee has arranged, near the
Bazaar, by the Kopemakers' quarter, in the large vacant
hall formerly occupied by the baths of El Thawer, a vast
chamber, in which he exhibits the wonders which he has
brought from foreign countries. Having paid money to a
negro at the door, you are introduced through obscure pas-
sages into a chamber as dark as Gehenna, and into a place
which they call a pit, where you sit in expectant terror, be-
fore an awful curtain, lighted but by a few faint lamps.

Many of the stoutest Agas and Effendis in Beyrout en-
tered this gloomy apartment, not without awe. The women
of the hareem of Papoosh Pasha were placed in a box,
guarded by a gilt cage ; as were the ladies of the establish-
ment of Bluebeard Bey, and the three wives of the Grand
Mollah. Women's curiosity, indeed, will go anywhere. As
the poet has sung, —



PANORAMA OF THE INGLEEZ. 375

*' There is no secret so dark, but the eye of Zntulbe will penetrate it.
There is no tangled skein, but the finger of Leila will unravel it.
There is no lock so cunning, but the crooked nose of the old hag
Fatima will pick it.

Indeed, a vast audience of the officers, lords, and topping
merchants of Beyrout were present to behold the Aboo
Bosh's wonderful pictures.

Before the curtain drew aside, and our eyes were dazzled,
our ears were diverted by a dexterous slave, who executed
the barbarous music of Europe, and the favorite songs of
the unbelievers, by merely turning the handle of a small
chest, called a Hurridee Gurridee. The handle operates
upon a number of bulbuls who are confined within the box,
each of whom at his signal comes forward and pipes in his
turn. One sings the hymn of the French Feringhees ; he
is called the Parees Yenn : when he is tired, another warbles
the war-song of the Ingleez; he is called the Roolbre-
tawnia : this over, a third nightingale begins to pipe the
delicious love-song of the Yangkees, who are a kind of In-
gleez, and the name of this song-bird is Yankeedoodool.
The sweetest of all the songs is this, and fills the heart with
delight.

When the birds are tired, he who turns the handle of the
box stops turning, and the music ceases with a melancholy
wail. And then, as in a blaze of splendor, the pictures be-
gin to pass before the astonished beholders.

The City represented yesterday was the City of Lun-
doon, which lies upon a river called the Tameez: over
which are twenty thousand bridges, each twenty hundred
parasangs in length, and to which there come daily a hun-
dred thousand ships.

In one quarter of Lundoon, during the winter months, it
is always night. It is illuminated, however, with fire, which
gushes out of the bowels of the earth, and affords a preter-
natural brilliancy. This quarter is called Stee ; twenty
thousand carriages rush thither every minute, each carriage
holding forty persons : the drivers and grooms crying out
" Stee, Stee ! " In this quarter the shroffs and principal
merchants reside. The palace of the Lord Cadi is here,
and each ward of the City has an Elderman ; who becomes
Cadi in his turn. They are all fat in this district, drinking
much of an intoxicating liquor made of citrons and rakee,
called Pan] or Poonj, and eating of a stew of tortoises, of
which they take many platefuls. Aboo Bosh owned to



876 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

having tasted and liked the stew, but about the liquor he
was silent.

After seeing the Merchants' quarter the view changed,
and exhibited to us the great Mosque of Paul, whereof the
dome is almost as high as Mount Lebanon. The faithful
pay two paras to enter this Mosque; which sum goes to
the support of the dervishes. Within, it is surrounded by
white images of captains, colonels, and effendis ; whose fig-
ures show that the Ingleez were but an ill-favored people.
In the court is an image of a beloved Queen : the people
say " Queen Anne is dead,'' and tear their beards to this
day, so much do they love her memory.

The next view was that of the building in which the
Councillors and men of law of the kingdom meet for their
affairs. In all Stamboul there is not such a palace. It is
carved without, and gilt within. The Chambers of Council
are endless : the chair of the Queen is a treasure of splen-
dor ; and Aboo Bosh says, that when she comes in state,
and surrounded by her viziers, this intrepid Sovereign of
an island race, that governs provinces more vast and distant
than Serendib and Hind, always carries in her arms three
lions. But the Hadjee did not see the Queen of the In-
gleez, and I doubt of this story.

Besides the Mosque of Paul, there is the Mosque of
Peter, whereof we likewise saw a view. All religions are
free in this country, but only one is paid. Some dervishes
shave the top of their heads, some tighten a piece of white
cloth round their necks, all are dressed in black ; — we saw
pictures of these, as also of the common people, the car-
riages, the Queen's janissaries in scarlet, with silver caps
on their heads, and cuirasses made of a single diamond.
These giants are all ten feet high ; their ofiicers fifteen : it
is said that each consumes a sheep, and drinks a barrel of
wine in the day.

Aboo then showed us the triumphal arch, near to tho
house of Wellingtoon Pasha, who has but to look from his
window and see his own image on horseback. Ten thou-
sand images of Wellingtoon are placed about the town, be-
sides : the English being so proud of him because he con-
quered the French General Boonapoort. But lovers of
poetry know the opinion of the bard : —

" The victory is not always with the bravest : nor the robe of honor
given to him who deserves most.
An eagle is shot down, and a leopard runs away with the spoil."



PANORAMA OF THE INGLEEZ. 377

Near this is the Maidaun, where the young Lords and
Agas ride, with nymphs as beautiful as those of Pai*adise,
arrayed in tight-fitting robes, and smiling from prancing
chargers.

And now came a buzz of wonder in the crowd, and out-
cries of delight from the women's boxes, which made the
eunuchs move about briskly with their rattans, when the
wonderful picture dawned upon us, representing the prodi-
gious Castle of Crystal and pavilion of light.

It is many miles long, and in height several furlongs. It
is built of rock crystal and steel, without putty, wood,
bricks, or nails. On the walls are flags, in number one hun-
dred and seventy-eight thousand. We said " Praise to Al-
lah ! " when we saw the scarlet standard, with the crescent
and star of our august master, Abdul Med j id.

This Palace was built in a single night by an enchanter
named Paxtoon. This wonderful man possesses all the se-
crets of nature ; he can make a melon in ten minutes grow
as big as a camel, a rose spread out before your eyes to the
size of an umbrella. Lately, in a convent of dervishes, he
caused in one evening a cabbage to grow so big, that after
hearing a sermon from one of their MoUahs, who got up
into the boughs, axes were brought, the plant was felled,
and the whole community dined off it; several bursting
with repletion, so delicious was the food. This was told
Aboo Bosh by a MoUah of Birmingham, a twisting dervish,
who had seen many wonders.

Having seen the exterior of this Hall of Light, Aboo Bosh
now showed to us the wondrous interior. All the treasures
of the world are there, surely. Ten hundred and ten thou-
sand persons come thither daily, and they all go first to see
the saddles and embroidery from Beyrout. What arcades of
splendor ! what fountains ! what images ! The tallest trees
grow in this palace. The birds cannot fly to the roof : it is
so high. At one end is a place where travellers are served
with cakes and sherbet by ravishing houris, with moon
faces. Aboo! Hadjee, I suspect that Fatima, your
one-eyed wife, has not heard the end of those tales ! What
says the poet ? —

** The best part of the tale is often that which is not told.
A woman s truth is like the cloth the Armenian sells you in the
bazaar : he always cribs a portion of it."

And now, having spent several hours in examining this



878 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

picture, the bulbul-box was again set in motion, and the
greatest curiosity of all was represented to us. This is an
Ingleez family of distinction, wnom Aboo Bosh has brought
with him, and who will be exhibited every day at tliJee
hours before, and three hours after sunset. But the ac-
count of their strange behavior shall be reserved for the
next Intelligence.



AN INGLEEZ FAMILY.



AN INGLEEZ FAMILY.
1851.




LL along, the Exhibition was
explained to us by a Fiank In-
terpreter, who understands per-
fectly our language.

Among the Ingleez, he said,
men are allowed but one wife :
a hard case, Agas ! for these
poor women ; for, as the bard
has remarked —

" When I am in a queer temper, in
mj hareem, I may beat Zuleika with
m; slipper, but I emile upon Leila and
ZQtulbe.

" When Leila's fatness becomes dis-
Bgreeable, then Zuinlbe's leanness
commences to be pleasing.

" When both aiiQoy me, then Uttle
Zuleika leaumes her reign ; foisttaw-
V berries ripen at one season of Ihejear,

So, for any poor c
be subject always to the ea-

E rices of one man, is cruel on
er; as to compel one man to
have but one wife, as amongst
the Ingleez, is a tyranny un-
heard of amoi^st civilized na-
tions like oui own j and we may
thank our stars that we do not
live in Luudoon, but Beyrout.
If all the old women among the Ingleez are no better-



380 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS,

looking than the one whom Aboo Bosh showed to us, I do
not envy the elderly gentlemen of that nation, and can quite
understand their habitual ill-humor.

In the first part of the play appeared this old woman, the
Khanum of the house, or "Misseez," as the Interpreter says
she is called ; her two daughters, Lola and Lota ; her son,
the young Aga ; and the father of the family, called Brown
Effendi.

Brown Effendi is fifty-five or six years old; he is tall
and of a portly shape, and, like all the elderly Ingleez, is
bald : nor has he the decency to cover his baldness with a
couple of caps, as we do, but appears with his shining pate
without any shame.

His wife is two or three years younger ; they must have
been married these thirty years : no wonder that they quar-
rel together, and that the Effendi is tired of such an old
hag!

The Interpreter explains that it is the beginning of the
day. A table is set out, covered with a snowy damask cloth,
with urns and vases of silver for tea, cups of porcelain, one
for each of the family, bits of roasted bread, hot cakes,
meat, honey, and butter. This meal the Ingleez of distinc-
tion take in common. An Effendi often does not behold
his family (always excepting the old hag of a wife) except
at that hour.

"Before the girls come down, and you go away to the
Stee, Mr. Brown,'' says the Misseez, "will you have the
goodness to give me some money ? Look at these bills."

" Jehannum take the bills ! " roars out Brown, rising up
and stamping. "Can't you let a man read his newspaper in
quiet ? "

Allah ! read his newspaper in quiet ? It is an immense
sheet, as big as the Capitan Pasha's mainsail. I should
think it has as many letters and lines as the Koran itself.
The Interpreter says, every Ingleez reads a paper every
morning — it is called in their language El Tims — from
beginning to end, every day, before going out. Praise be to
Heaven that we live in Beyrout !

"Well, don't swear at a woman, Mr. B.," she says.
" Don't swear when the children and servants are coming
in. How can I help it, if the house is expensive ? I lived
in a better before I came to yours. My mamma " —

" Confound your mamma ! How much is it ? " says
Brown Effendi ; and drawing a paper from his pocket-book,
he writes an order to his shroff to pay so much money.



AN INGLE EZ FAMILY. 381

The daughters now come in — there was a great sensation
among us, especially in that rogue who sat by me, Poof
Alice, who is always on the look-out for almond eyes. These
virgins were young and fait, of fine shapes seemingly, wear-
ing a sort of loose gowns buttoned up to the neck, with
little collars and little caps, with little ribbons ; their cheeks
pale, their eyes heavy — nevertheless, comely damsels, that
would fetch a round sum of piastres in the market.

" Why don't you come sooner ? " growls the father.

" They were at Lady Polk's, at Mrs. Walls's, and were
not home till four : the girls must have sleep, Mr. B."

" Why do they go to those confounded balls ? " asks
Brown Effendi. The Interpreter explains that a ball is a
dance where many hundred women assemble.

"They ought to be in bed at ten," growls the house-
father.

" We do go to bed at ten when there is nothing at night.
Papa," says the eldest. " We couldn't live if we didn't go
to sleep on the off nights."

"You don't wish them not to go in the world, I sup-
pose, Mr. B. ? You don't wish them not to get establish-
ments ? You don't suppose it is for my pleasure that I go
about night after night with these poor things, whilst you
are drinking with your male friends, or at your clubs ! "
(The Interpreter explains that a Club is the Coffee-house
of the Ingleez : they sit there smoking until late hours.)
" You don't suppose that / go to dance ? "

Brown Effendi burst into a laugh. " You dance, Polly ! "
says he. " Do I suppose the cow jumped over the moon ? "

" I wish Papa wouldn't use those expressions," says Miss
Lola to Liss Lota.

Papa now sits with his face buried in M Tims, and when
he has read it (only in this Exhibition, or play, of course,
the actor did not read the whole of the immense sheet, or
we should have sat till night) — this labor over, and his
breakfast done, he goes away to Stee.

" That is the commencement of the day with thousands of
English Effendis in Lundoon," the Interpreter explains.
" He rises at eight. He shaves. He meets his family :
kisses them, but rarely speaks, except to swear a little and
find fault. He reads through £Jl Tims. He gives money
to the Khanum. He goes to the Stee : where his counting-
house or office of business is, and which is often a long way
from his house. He goes on foot, while his wife has a
chariot."

" That I can understand," says Poof Allee. " A man will
not allow his womankind to go out except in an aroba,
guarded by the slaves. Even an unbeliever is not such a
fool as thatJ^

"You are in error, Effendi," said the Interpreter.
"The women are free to go whithersoever they please.
They wear no veils. They go about the City unprotected,
save by a male servant, and even he is not necessary. They
frequent the shops, and bazaars, and public gardens. I
have seen ten thousand in the Spring-time basking in the
gardens of Kensington.'^

" my eyes ! I will go there," said Poof Allee, stroking
his beard, that sly rogue.

" They are to be seen everywhere," continues the Inter-
preter, " and at home, too, receive men into their houses."

" This, I suppose, is one," remarked a looker-on. " He is
splendid ; he is tall ; he has richly-carved buttons on his
coat. He takes up the silver urn. Is this an officer of the
Sultaun ? "

" That ? That is a servant," said the Dragoman. " He
is bringing breakfast for the young Effendi, who comes
down later than the rest of the family."

" That," cried Poof Allee, " a servant ? Why, he is a
pearl of beauty. He is a Roostum. He is strong, tall,
young, and lovely. Does an old Ingleez allow such an An-
tar as that to walk about in his hareem ? Psha ! friend
Interpreter, you are joking."

" It is even so, sir," said the Dragoman. " So strange is
the pride of certain classes of the Ingleez, and so barbar-
ous — blasphemous, I had almost said — their notions with
regard to rank, that the aristocracy among the Ingleez take
no more account of the persons below them, than your
Honor does of the black slave-boy who fills your pipe. And
of late, one of the lootees — or buffoons among the Ingleez
— acquired no small share of popularity, and received from
his bookseller ten thousand pieces of gold, for a book of
jests, in which a servant was made the principal hero, and
brought to live among Lords and Agas — the point of the
jest being, that the servant was made to feel like a man."

Here came in the young actor, who, the Interpreter said,
represented the son of the house. He drawled into the
apartment, nodded languidly to his sisters, kissed his
mother's forehead, and sank into the vacant chair by his
sisters.



AN INGLE EZ FAMILY. 383

He called to the servant. " John ! " he said, " pale
ale ! "

" My love ! '' said the mamma.

" Tell the cook to devil some dam thing/' continued the
youth.

" My darling ! " said the old lady.

" Hot coppers, ma'am ! " said the young man, pulling a
little tuft of hair on his chin. " Keep sad hours — know I
do. Out on the crawl till five o'clock this morning. Last
thing I weckolect, shandy-gaff."

" You'll kill yourself, child," cried mamma.

"So much the better for brother Dick. Youth is the
season of enjoyment. dam ! what a headache I've got !
* Gather ye roses while ye may.' Youth is the season of
pleasure."

" What sort of pleasure ? " asked one of the sisters.

"Well — I think it was with two cabmen off the stand,
at Bob Cwoft's," said the young man. " It's not very good
fun, but it's better than those dam balls that you go to
every night. Here comes the breakfast."

And the curtain-bell ringing, the first part of the enter-
tainment was over.

During the interval, the Interpreter continued to explain
to us the manners and customs of this queer people : and
the curtain again rising, showed us a view of the Queen's
Palace (before which there is a figure of a Lion and Uni-
com, which makes one die of laughing ) ; the Courts of
Justice, the Castle of Windsor, which seems, indeed, a pa-
vilion of splendor in a rose-garden of delight ; and an im-
mense hole bored under the sea, the dark appearance of
which made poor Poof AUee shudder. And now, having
seen the Ingleez in the morning, and heard how the men
pass the day in their offices and counting-houses, the women
m the shops buying, in their carriages, in the gardens, vis-
iting one another, and receiving company at home, — the
Dragoman said, "We shall show them as they are dressed
of an evening, expecting visitors for the evening."

The curtain drew up. Brown Effendi was now dressed
with a white band round his neck, that made his eyeballs
start out of his head, and his red face blaze like the stand-
ard of the Sultan. Mrs. Brown appeared so changed since
the morning, that you would not tiiow her, and Poof AUee
(that rogue) said, " my eyes ! the old woman to-night
looks quite young, and I always liked a stout woman."

They stood one on each side of the fireplace — the Inter-
preter said, in the attitude of receiving dinner company.

Schaun, the servant, came in with a note on a silver
salver.

"It's from Wagg," said Brown Effendi. "D — ^n him!
he says he's ill ; but he's asked by a lord, and has thrown
us over. Take away one cover, John.*'

How splendidly attired now is this Schaun ! His cos-
tume of the morning is nothing to that which he now
wears. A white coat barred with gold lace ; a waistcoat of
red and gold; shulwars of plush, the color of buttercups —
and has he grown gray since the morning ? No, he has put
powder into his hair. He is beautiful to behold : a peacock
is not finer.

And now, who enter ? Who are these two houris ? Who
are these moon-faced ones, with the lustrous ringlets, the
round arms, the shining shoulders? The heart beats to
behold theuL Poof Alice's eyes brighten with rapture.
They are the damsels of the morning, Lola and Lota.

" This is the habit of Ingleez damsels," says the Inter-
preter, with rather a sly look. " All day they cover them-
selves up, but at night, because it is cold, they go with very
little clothes. They are now going to dinner ; they wiU
then go to a concert ; they will then drive to a ball or
danca"

" But a ball, of course, only amongst women ? " said his
Excellency Papoosh Pasha, Governor of Beyrout, who was
smoking his kaboon in a box near the stage.

" Among women, excellent sir ! There are men, too. If
there were no men, the women would stay at home. This
is the way that the Ingleez " —

" Silence, shameless ! " roared out his Excellency. " Kis-
lar Beg ! Carry my women home this moment. Stop the
Exhibition. All the principles of morality are violated.
Women in that dress show themselves to men? Never!
or if they do, it can only be among barbarians, and such a
fact must not be known in a civilized country. Hadjee
Aboo Bosh ! this part of the Exhibition must be no more
represented under pain of the bastinado." And his Excel-
lency flung out of the room in a passion, and the Exhibi-
tion ended abruptly.

As for Poof AUee — that rogue — he has gone off to Eng-
land by the last Peninsular and Oriental steamer.

THOSE who know Topliam Sawyer, the accomplished

he was ashamed of them ; and not blameless, alas ! in his
life, he is correct, even to fastidiousness, in his spelling —
in this affording an example to many of the younger no-
bility ; and may be pardoned some of his bitterness, which
may be set to the account of his well-known disappoint-
ment, two years since (when he was as yet but the penni-
less and Honorable Topham Sawyer), when the lovely Lady
Barbara Pendragon, daughter, we need scarcely state, of the
Marquis of M-ngelw-rzelshire, threw him over, and mar-
ried the Eoman Prince Corpodibacco, nephew of the Cardi-
nal of that name. Trifles from the pens of the great are
always acceptable in certain circles ; and the following ex-
tract of a letter from Lord Swellmore to his intimate and
noble friend the Marquess of Macassar, though on a trifling
subject, will be read not without interest by those who
admire our country's institutions. The noble Earl, whilst
waiting at his club to see Messrs. Aminadab and Nebu-
chadnezzar on pecuniary business, having promised to write
to the Marquess of Macassar at Paris Tindeed, concerning
bills of exchange, on which both the noble lords are liable),
dashed off a letter, partly on private affairs, and concluding
with the following lively passages : —

I sit here, mj dear Macass, and see the people go by to the Exhibition.
It's better than going there. Suave mari magno : you see the ocean dev-
ilish well from the shore. You're only sick if you go to sea. I wish
they'd give us a smoking-room fronting Piccadilly. Why don't the new
men who have been building, have smoking-rooms to the street ? I like
those fellows at Brighton who sit on the cliff, in a ground-floor room,
smoking — after dinner — having nuts and port wine at three o'clock on
Sundays. I saw a fellow there lately — his stout old wife went out to
church — and there he sat, with his legs on the second chair, unbuttoned,
and looking out of window with a jolly red face. I felt inclined to put my
hand in and take a glass, and say, ** Your health, old boy ! " His cigars
smelt offensively, but I envied him rather — not that I envy anylK>dy
much, or pity anybody, or despise anybody, or admire anybody. I've
nothing what you call to live for — now you have, Macass. You're very
fond of your whiskers, and anxious about overcoming your waist. Yon
have an aim, my boy, and a purpose in your existence; coax your whis-
kers, and struggle manfully with your corporation, my poor old Macass,
and thank your stars that you have these to interest you.

Here's a fellow who has had an object in life, too, it appears. I cut his
advertisement out of the Times. It's a devilish deal better than the lead-
ing article.

"p\UTCH PUG FOR SALE — a very fine specimen of this almost ex-
■^ tinct breed. He is one year and a half old, and very gay and lively,
and is the bond fide property of a gentleman who, from continued ill-
health, is unable to keep him. Lowest price 30 guineas. No dealer need
apply, either directly or indirectly. May be seen at Mr. Harridge's Forge,
Pitt Street Mews, Park Lane.



POOR PUGGY, 387

Now, I say, here^s something to excite your sympathy. An announce-
ment more affecting than this can't well be imagined — a dog of an almost
extinct breed, and the owner of that rare animal obliged, from continued
ill-health, to part with him'. Think, my dear Macass, of a tender and
benevolent-minded man, his fine faculties overclouded by disease, fondly
attached to his darling pug, yet seeing that between him and that beloved
being a separation must come ! The last interviews are now taking place
between them : the last breakfast : the last fricassee of chicken : the last
saucers of cream ; the little darling is now lapping them up, and licking
the hand which shall soon pat its black nose no more. He is " gay and
lively " now, the poor little bep^gar —quite unconscious of his commg fate
— but eighteen months old — it s heartrending, — ain't it 1

What degree of ill-health is it, or what species of malady can it be,
which obliges a gentleman to part from such a 6ona^</6 dariing? This
invalid's ill -health is "contmuons," the advertisement says. Do the
caresses of the pug increase his master's comf)laint ? Does continued
anxiety for the pretty favorite prevent the owner's return to strength, and
must he wean himself from the little black-nosed, cock-tailed, cream-
colored innocent, as delicate mammas do from their babies^ What a
separation, men Dieu I Poor Pnggy ! Poor poor Master !

Of course, he won't part with him to a dealer, directly or indirectly ; no,
no. Fancy a man's feelings, the separation over, at seeing Puggy some day
in the Quadrant, in the red- waistcoat pocket of a dirty-looking black-
guard, with six other dogs, and a wide-awake hat I An invalid, as this gen-
tleman is, couldn't stand such a sudden shock. He would be carried off to a
chemist's; and we should hear of an inquest on a gentleman at the '' White
Bear." PuL'gy in the Quadrant — Puggy in the company of all sorts of
low dogs, brought up in the worst habits, and barking in the vulgarest
manner 1 Pugiry, the once beautiful and innocent, in the Quadrant ! —
Oh don't — I can't bear the *orrid thought !

But must a man be in high health to keep a Dutch pug ? Does the care
and anxiety incident on Dutch pn^r-keeping make a man of naturally
robust habit ill and delicate ? If so, it's most generous of the owner of
the little Dutchman to warn the public. You pay thirty guineas — the
very lowest price — you incur responsibility, infinite care, unrest, disease.
You lose your peace of mind, and break your heart in cherishinir this
darling ; and then you part with him. You recollect what happened to
the heroes in Homer, how they were made to dogs a prey. Here is a
modem torn in pieces by a little pug.

A little Dntcn pug, with a little tumed-np black nose. And is there
no other pretty possessor of a nez retrouss^^ which man coaxes and dandles,
and feeds with cream and chicken, and which he parts with after a
struggle ? Ah, my good fellow ! Ah, my dear Macassar ! We are sad
dogs ! we are cvnical ! You take my allusion, and your knowledge of the
world will enable you to understand the allegory of

Your affectionate

SWELLMORE.

PORTRAITS FROM THE LATE EXHIBITION.

1851.

AS a popular contemporary has given a number of highly
interesting portraits and biographies of gentlemen
connected with the Exhibition, whose families and friends
will naturally provide themselves with copies of their rela-
tives' lives and countenances, Mr. Punch, ever anxious to
benefit self and public, has it in contemplation to ornament
his journal with

LIVES AND PORTRAITS OF THE EXHIBITORS

Who have not gained prizes at the Exposition of 1851.

And to this highly interesting class he strongly recom-
mends his publication, of which, if but six copies weekly be
taken by every Exhibitor, a decent remuneration cannot
fail to attend the labors of Mr. P.

As specimens taken at hazard merely, Mr. Punch offers
for the present week the following biographies and por-
traits.

Mr. Podgers is the eldest son, though the third child,
of Major Podgers, of the Horse Marines, which he com-
manded, on the death of their Colonel, in the flotilla action
in the Bay of Fundy. The Major married Bella, seventh
daughter of Sir Muffton Wroggles, of Wrogglesby, North-
amptonshire, in which county the old Saxon family of
Wroggles, or Worogles, has been located since the days of
AKred. The Podgers family, though ancient, is not of such
antiquity. Mr. Podgers received his elementary education
under the care of the Reverend Doctor Grig, at North-
ampton, whence he was removed to Harrow-on-the-Hill,
where he would have been a contemporary of Doctor Parr,
Sir William Jones, Lord Byron, and Sir Robert Peel, had he
been placed at this famous school while those eminent in-

dividuals were studying there It does not appear that
Maater Podgers took any pnzes at Harrow any more than
at the Exhibition of 18i>l his genius though useful, not
being brilliant and his powers of applicat on being only
trifling.

Mr. Podgers was removed from Harrow to Goppernose

distinguished for classical attainments, he was very near
gaining the prize of valor in a single combat with a gigan-
tic bargeman at Iffiey Lock ; but the mariner proved the
better man, and an injury to Mr. Podgers's nose was the
only permanent consequence of the rencontre.

It was not till 1823 that he inherited, by the demise of
the gallant Major, his father, his estate of Hodgers-Podgers,

Hants, where he now resides, occupying himself with agri-
cultural pursuits, and with hunting, although increasing
years and weight have rather wearied him of that occupar
tion. Mr. Podgers is a magistrate and a married man ; Uie
father (by Emily, daughter of the Eeverend Felix Rabbits)
of thirteen children.

His spud was invented towards the close of the yeai
1850, and it is unnecessary to particularize this invention,
whidi has not been found to answer better than, or indeed
to differ greatly from, implements of a like simple nature.

Mr. Podgers's opinions a^ a politician are well known.
Not noisy, he is consistent ; and has often been heard to
say, that if all England were like him, we should get Pro-
tection back again. England being of the contrary opinion,
no such result is expected. He ia threescore years old, and
weighs, we should think, a good fourteen stone ten.

Mrs. Glinders retained by marrying her cousin, her own
maiden and respectable name Mr Glinders her father,
has long been known as a distinguished medical practitioner
at Bath. Mr. Fitzroy Glinders her husband is a solicitor
in that city.

In Bath, or its charming neighborhood, the chief part of



PORTRAITS FROM THE LATE EXHIBITION. 391

the existence of Mrs. G-linders has been passed. It was
here that she contracted, in the year 1836, that matri-
monial engagement with the Reverend Mr. Fiddlebury,
which was so scandalously broken off by the Reverend
Gentleman, who married Miss Bluff. The jury of an
offended country awarded Miss G-linders 600Z. for the dam-
age thus done to her affections, which sum she brought as
dowry to her cousin, the (then) young Fitzroy Glinders,
who conducted her case. Their union has been blessed
with a considerable family, and indeed. Mr. Glinders's
quiver is so full of them, that he has been obliged to take
another pew at church.

The washerwoman of Bath has ever had a constant
friend in Mrs. Glinders. The thoughtless chimney-sweep,
the ignorant dog's-meat man of her own city, have always
been plentifully supplied by her with means for bettering
their spiritual condition. The . Caffres and Mandingoes
have found her eager in their behalf.

The counterpane, sent for previous exhibition to the
national Exposition, is intended finally as a present for
the King of Quacco. It is woollen, striped blue and pink,
with a rich fringe of yellow and pea-green. It occupied
Mrs. Glinders two hundred and seventy-four evenings, and
the prime cost of the wool was 111. 14s. Qd. For a web
which was to pass under the eyes of her own Sovereign,
over the feet of another, though a benighted, monarch, Mrs.
Glinders thought justly that expense was not to be re-
garded. She had fits on not finding her name in the prize
list, and had even entertained an idea that Mr. Glinders
would receive a public honor. But time and her own strong
spirit will console Mrs. Glinders under these disappoint-
ments : and for the sake of her family and friends, it is to
be hoped that she will be, in the words (slightly altered) of
our immortal bard, " herself again."

Horatio Nelson Slamcoe was born in the New Cut, Lam-
beth, in the year when England lost her greatest naval
hero. His mother, having witnessed the funeral procession
of Trafalgar's conqueror, determined to bestow on her child,
if a son, the glorious names of the departed ; hence, in due
time, the two Christian names of the subject of this me-
moir. The parents of Mr. Slamcoe were in humble life ;
and for the eminence which he has subsequently acquired,
he has to thank his genius rather than his education, which

was neglected for the labora necessary to one whose own
hands must work his own livelihood.

Well and skilfully, through five-and-thirty years, have the
hands of Horatio Slamcoe toiled. Early taken under the
roof of a tonsorial practitioner in the Waterloo Boad, Mr,
Slamcoe learned the rudiments of a trade which by bim has
been elevated to an art ; for if to imitate beautiful Nature
be Art, what man deserves the proud name of artist better
than the elegant perruquier. At twenty-one years of age,
Mr. Slamcoe had the honor of attending at L-mb-th Palace,
with a wig, made by his young hands, and offered to a late
reverend Prelate of our Church. Professor S. augured ill
for Episcopacy when those ornaments of our dignified di-
vines fell into desuetude.




OB "slamcoe's



As Napoleon crowned himself King and Emperor, so it
was, we believe, that Horatio Slamcoe dubbed himself Pro-
fessor. His inventions are known to the world, and their
beneficent influence is exemplified in his own person.
Before he ever attempted Continental travel, his " Balsam
of Bohemia " was discovered ; just as America waa dis-

covered by Columbus before that philosophic Genoese put
foot on shipboard. His Tuscan Dentifrice ; his Carthaginian
Hair-dye ; his Fountain of Hebe, are world-celebrated cos-
metics, without which (he says) no toilet is complete.
They are to be procured at his establishment, " The College
of Beauty," with the usual liberal allowance to the trade,
who should beware of unprincipled imitators, only too eager
to adopt the discoveries of the Professor.

That the Kalonaturae, or Gent's Own Head of Hair,
should have been unrewarded by a Medal, is one of those
instances which cries shame on the awards of the Com-
mittee. Let us hope it was not a conspiracy on the part
of rival wig-makers (enemies of Mr. Slamcoe through life)
which defeated the object of his ambition. But if there
be any individuals blighted like himself, whose hair turned
white in a single night, as some men's has through dis-
appointment, the Professor recommends to such his Car-
thaginian dye, which will prevent the world, at least, from
guessing what ravages grief has caused, and manly pride
would hide ; though it will scarcely be credited, the Pro-
fessor's ovm hair is indebted for its rich jelly color solely
to the Carthaginian discovery.

tannia : some of my brother poets I am told (I am consid-
ered one of the first in the world) labor under a similar
obtuseness of ear.

" But this is parenthetic ; let us return to the subject in
hand. I select you as the organ of my communications
from the seat of War ; 1st, Because the Press though often
misled is free in your country. And I desire the liberty of
saying everything which I could not do in the Journal des
Debats or the Allgemeine Zeitung : 2d, because I know you
exercise a great influence in Europe ; and have seen per-
sonally the three Emperors, my friend the King of Naples,
and His Holiness the Pope, and Cardinal Antonelli frantic at
your satire : 3d, because, strange to say, you appear to have
engaged no correspondent : and 4th, because I am the best
correspondent in the world.

" I took, but half an hour since, from the shako of a poor
Russian friend, whom I have just killed in action, two or
three copies of the Times newspaper, in which the editors
seemed greatly to vaunt the skill of their correspondent in
this quarter. Before I ever thought of putting pen to paper
myself, I met this young man at Malta, and Gallipoli after-
wards ; gave him every information in my power, and sup-
plied him with many of the facts, which I need not say he
ludicrously distorted and exaggerated in his journal. He
was put out of an English ship of war (he says, at his own
desire) on board of a Greek schooner, the Hagid Alethea, off
Gallipoli, and would, have been murdered by the crew and
the master (a pirate, and a very old friend of mine) for the
sake of his portmanteaus, which appeared to be pretty well
plenished, had I not happened to be drinking in the cabin
with my friend the piratical skipper. At my entreaties,
nay threats (for I had to produce my revolvers), the young
man was saved ; and I landed him at Gallipoli stairs, with
his bag and baggage, without receiving from him even the
present of a single cigar. Nor, as I see by his printed
letters, has he made the least subsequent mention of his
preserver: it will be well for him not to come into the
neighborhood of the 14th Bashi-Bazouks, or their Colonel.
I shall not give him any information any more. What I
have I shall send to you, and through you to the world; and
thus my indignation at the ingratitude of a newspaper
writer is possibly the cause of enlightening and instruct-
ing all Europe.

" Hitherto, all Europe has been wofuUy misled. Any one,

for instance, who will take the trouble to tot up the number
of dead Russians who are slaughtered in every newspaper
bulletin that we get from the seat of war in the East, will
find that they drop off at the rate of two or three thousand
a day, and that a quarter of a million of them by this time
must have gone to visit Hades. My good friend, Mr.
Punch, these murderous histories are all bosh ! Newspaper
correspondents, I fully agree with my noble friends Lord
Smotherem and Lord Botherem, in the House of Peers, are
not to be relied upon, and ought to be put down. As for
the Turks, they are notorious long-bow pullers. My poor
friends the Russians, with and against whom I have served
a good deal in the Caucasus, are greater liars than the im-
believers. What the nation wants is Truth. Truth pure.
Truth unadulterated. Truth gushing from the original tap,
such as perhaps nor other man in Europe but myself is in a
condition to supply.

" I choose to sign myself Verax, though that of course is
not my family name, which is the noblest in the three king-
doms ; but I have such a regard for truth in all things, that
even of this little deviation from it I think fit to warn
the reader. I never told a lie in my life (except, of course,
a few to ladies, whom, I presume, no gentleman thinks of
treating with the unadulterated article). I have lost for-
tunes — undergone imprisonment — braved and suffered
the most frightful tortures for truth's sake. Every word of
my letters may be relied upon ; and I should like to know
of what hireling scribe and camp-follower, of what ancient
or modern writer — in a word, except myself — as much can
be said ? Take a page of Macaulay — pooh ! Ask the
Quakers, or the old Tories, what they think of his ac-
counts of the two Williams — William of Orange and Wil-
liam of Drap ? Read Dean Milman's * History of the Latin
Church;' learned and wise it is undoubtedly, — but if it
were true, would Dr. Wiseman be wearing crimson silk
gloves (with a crowd of boys laughing at him in the streets),
and Father Newman be cutting jokes against the Establish-
ment ? Take Sir Archibald Alison's History, and if you
can read that — but it is absurd that I should put so mon-
strous a proposition.

" I speak about these gentlemen from memory of course
(mine is the finest and most accurate in the world) ; but a

tains of Anapa before me, the hoarse roar of the Black Sea
disceiDible to my ear, the sun gilding the battered old min-
arets of Redout-Kaleh, from which we have just driven out
the Russians, and where I have hanged a rascally Greek
spy Rafter addressing him a most beautiful speech in his na-
tive language, with which and twenty-three other European
dialects I am perfectly familiar) ; and where, in the affair
of the morning, it was my painful duty to send a ball from
my revolver through the eye of my poor old friend. Major
Timkowski, at the head of his regiment — a man with
whom I have drunk many a bottle in happier times ; — I
say, were a man in my present position to pretend that he
carried books about with him, and like Frederic or Napoleon
had a campaign library, he would be humbugging the pub-
lic. No, honest Selim Aga, cooking the lamb yonder under
my nose (by the laws, it smells very savory, and a man who
has not eaten for forty-nine hours, ridden two hundred and
ten parasangs, had two horses and a mule shot under him,
routed three regiments and fourteen squadrons of the en*
emy, taking nine of his guns, four of them with his own
hand, shot a lamented friend through the eye, and hanged a
Greek spy, has a right to feel a little hungry) — Selim, the
cook, I say, might as well expect to turn out a regular
dinner of three courses, soup, fish, entrees, and confec-
tionery, from the carcass of yonder lamb, as to produce a
regular, careful, philosophical, ornate history, such as some
of my other works have been, and such as I should turn out
if I were seated at ease in one of my splendid libraries,
either in my town house or in my castles in the country.

" Though we have quarrelled, I cannot but always remem-
ber that the Emperor of Russia was long my most partic-
ular friend. When I used to drive over to take tea with
the family at Czwrkow Seloe (for at St. Petersburg we stood
of course much more upon etiquette) he was affable, even
playful in his conversation, and would often say to me,
* Mick, my boy ' ^I bear the name of the Archangel. I am
descended from kings, and my ancestors, whose lineal heir

" I may say now that the war never would have happened
had the Emperor listened to the advice of an old friend,
who knows men and the world as well as many a man who
wears a star upon his breast, and writes Privy Councillor
before his name. I never could get the Emperor of Russia
to believe in the possibility of an alliance between us and
the French. ^ Look at these newspapers,' he used to say to
me, rapping with his knuckles on the table, a daily London

journal of great circulation, the T , and a weekly comic

periodical called P ,* under the satire of which he

writhes : —

" * The head of the French nation never can pardon these
attacks upon him. He must declare war against England.
England must enter into an alliance with me ; and as the
price of that alliance, I intend to have Turkey in Europe,
and my second capital at Constantinople. VoUa tout, mon
cher, voila tout.'

"^Parbleu! C'est tout simple,' saiji a great dignitary
whom I need not name for fear of getting him into trouble,
shrugging his shoulders, and pulling out his eternal snuff-
box.

" I took a pinch myself, and tried to show them what
the real state of our press and our country was. I told the
Emperor Nicholas that I had long and intimately known
his Majesty the Emperor of the French, as indeed I had in
Switzerland, where I put his first musket into his hands ;
in the United States have I saved his life ; at Ham, where
I saw him and the poor dear Duchesse de Berri before him,
and in King Street, St. James's, and about town, where I
promise you we have had some rare doings together. I told
the Emperor of Russia that his Majesty the Emperor of
the French knew England well, and narrated to him in con-
fidence, but in extenso, a conversation which I had had with
Prince Louis Napoleon, when we were special constables

* His Majesty, between ourselves, is not so thin in the legs and so large

"Camp under Redoubt Kale,

13th Shiboob, 1271.

" My Dear Sir, — The sudden departure of my Tatar yes-
terday prevented me from making a statement which would
have been as well at the commencement of my correspond-
ence, and explaining at full my reasons for joining the Turk-
ish army, and the peculiar means of information which I pos-
sess now I am here. O'Looney, my second in command, is
also here (the honest fellow, late an officer in the Nizam's
service, is snoring on his sheepskins within a couple of yards
of me), but what means of information does he possess ?
He can judge the best taps in the various taverns of Scutari
and Pera, is a connoisseur in horseflesh, and a great con-
sumer of raki ; but he knows no more about the war than
my two black slaves which the Sultana Valide gave me
when I took leave of her three weeks since at Constanti-
nople.

"To resume my St. Petersburg narrative, then, and the
causes of my quitting that capital and taking arms against
its sovereign, with whom I have always been on terms of
most friendly and affectionate intercourse. The Imperial
treatment of me, and the scoundrelly behavior of a certain
lieutenant of police, — behavior of which I have reason to
think the highest personages in the Russian empire were
not ignorant, are the causes why I transferred my services,
my great strategetical knowledge, and my exterminating
projectiles (of which the War and the world will hear ter-
rific news ere long) to His Highness Abdul Medjeed. I do
not conceal that my sympathies are not with these Turks.
They must ere long be swept out of Europe. Why should
there not be an Emperor in Byzantium as well as in Peters-
burg ? Say he were a Eussian prince. Why not ? The
Eomanoff of Turkey and the Eomanoff of Eussia would
presently and infallibly quarrel, as the French and Spanish
Bourbons did. I am not particularly angry with Nicholas

for meditating and attempting his great coup ; but his con-
duct towards myself, the traitorous behavior of his subor-
dinates, the indignities offered to a person of royal lineage
— thirteen dozen with the knout administered at midnight
in my rooms at the Hotel d'Angleterre, and a treacherous
banishment into Siberia afterwards ; conduct such as this,
I say, was enough to put any man in a rage, and to justify
the defiance which hereby, and in the face of all Europe, I
hurl at the Autocrat of Russia.

" Knowing that England had set a price on my head after
that wretched affair of Ballingarry, which but for Smith
O'Brien's foolish quarrel about the succession to the throne
with me might have had a very different issue,* and that
my return home was impossible, the Emperor had made
me advantageous proposals for entering into his service —
proposals which I do not scruple to say I had entertained.
The Grand Cross of the Russian St. George might have fig-
ured advantageously on a bosom which beats with only a
chivalrous enmity against the Cappadocian warrior, who is
England's patron. The rank of General and Marshal (on
old Paskiewitch's retirement) might gratify an honest ambi-
tion, and the title of MuUiganoff-Innisfailsky, of which the
patent was actually made out, might be worn without shame,
by one whose loftier claims and regal rights have been reft
from him by the evil chance of war.

" But when war was declared between the Emperor and
the three kingdoms, there was one of them, as I told his
Majesty, against which I never would fight. Unaccustomed
for the last thirty years to contradiction from any quarter,
you never saw a man in a greater rage than the Emperor
Nicholas when I conveyed to him my firm but respectful
resignation of his proposals. His usage of his Grand
Chaiaberlain, who happened to be in the room, wa§ abso-
lutely humiliating. The entreaties of the poor dear Em-
press and the Imperial children and grandchildren (who J
believe love me like one of the family) were difficult tc«
withstand : harder still to bear were the wretched appealing
looks, the tears welling in the beautiful azure eyes, the lips
quivering with emotion, the soft little hands clasped in

unavailing supplication, of the lovely Matilda Schouvoff,

hare always preferred to face a thousand guns in battery




than the tears of a loving woman. Every gentleman will
understand the agonies I felt in my battle with one who
had been so victorious over my heart.

"My dispute with his Majesty and my rejection of his
proposals took place on the very day, I think it was the
18th of January last, when that poor deputation of Quakers,



IMPORTANT FROM THE SEAT OF WAR. 403

- as you remember, had their final interview with the despotic
ruler over sixty millions of men. That the Emperor is
a master of dissimulation is clear, not only from certain
documents which have come to light subsequently, but from
his behavior towards those honest, broad-brimmed gentle-
men whom he most imperially bamboozled. They and I
lodged at the same hotel, the Hotel d'Angleterre, on the
Nepomuk Platz ; and with one of the junior members of the
peaceful party, an agreeable lively fellow, young Dobkins,
of Godmanchester, I became rather intimate. I introduced
him to the Guards' barracks, took him about the town to
the public places, and presented him in some of the most
fashionable houses, where *le beau quakre,' as he was
sailed, was a considerable favorite. Out of his ridiculous
costume, which he only wore on parade, he was an exceed-
ingly handsome young fellow, not a little like myself, as
the dear Matilda insisted, though I am some nine inches
broader between the shoulders, and twelve inches less in the
waist than my young broad-brimmed acquaintance.

" We passed several merry evenings, and had rather a
pleasant table d'h6te at the H6tel d'Angleterre, where,
however, there was one guest who, for private reasons, as
well as for his own disgusting behavior, was especially
odious to me ; this was no other than the notorious Count
Tuffskin, who is known at every gambling house in Europe,
who is at present commandant at Tamboff, and had come to
the capital to solicit promotion ; and what is more, to dis-
pute with me the hand of the lovely Matilda Schouvoff. He
slept in the apartment No. 7, contiguous to my room. No. 8,
on the second floor : many a time have I heard the fellow
snoring, whilst I myself was pacing my chamber (haply
turning verses in honor of Matilda), and longing to go in
and strangle my rival. Matilda's mother was on my side,
whilst her father, from old family connection, inclined to-
wards Tuffskin.

"His Excellency Prince Schouvoff is President of the
Secret Correctional Police of St. Petersburg, an institution
which everybody knows and fears in that capital, and no-
body talks about. As I have broken with the Romanoff
Court, there is no reason why I should keep the secret or
hesitate to divulge the scandal. Some years since in your
own paper I remember there was a jocular account of a
Eussian dignitary in London being awakened in his apart-
ments at Long's or Mivart's, or it may have been Grillion's,

but the hotel does not matter, by four drummers of the
Preobajenski regiment, who entered his room disguised as
waiters, and then and there gave him three dozen each,
taking his receipt for the same. Every word of that nar-
rative is true ; there's scarcely a man in St. Petersburg but
for some offence to the Court he has had a visit from the
Secret Correctional Police. What was the meaning at the
commencement of the present season of Chamberlain X
keeping his bed, and Prince Y.'s lumbago ? This discipline
is so common, so sharp and decisive, that nobody dare speak
of it above his breath, and it is dreadful to thmk how many
of this proud nobility have had a taste of the rattan.

"I have spoken before of this degrading punishment
having been conferred upon me — upon me the descendant
of kings, the inheritor and representative of centuries of
honor ! not actually, for had I received a blow, the Chief

of the house of Romanoff or that of M would now be

no more ; but in intent the insult remains to be terribly
avenged, though the degrading knout descended upon the
shoulders of another.

"The thing was the talk of Petersburg, as Petersburg
talks — under its breath — and what really happened was
briefly this. Count Tuffskin, like too many of the Eussian
nobility, indulges in the habit of frequent inebriation, and
on the night after that painful morning and interview in
which I had resigned the Emperor's service, Tuffskin, my-
self, one or two of the younger Quakers, and a few more
habitues of the hotel, partook of a farewell supper. It was
Wednesday, and our Quaker friends were to go on Friday,
and gave us the last evening which was free.

" During the supper I received a little note — blessings
be on the hand! — which I read, kissed, and put in my
pocket, not heeding the vulgar jokes of Tuffskin, and de-
spising his low satire.

" He had already drank several bottles of Clicquot. I
now pressed him with brandy ; the wretch drank until he
was perfectly intoxicated, when I took him, reeling and
senseless, and conducted him to bed.

" I put him into my room. No. 7 (it has a beautiful pros-
pect over the Neva, the four bridges, the Naval Arsenal,
the Pauloff Palace, and the Nevski Prospect. The house
is dear, but perhaps the best in Petersburg.) I put Tuffskin
into my room. No. 7, and into my bed ; aAd I went into his
room. No. 8.

" At two o'clock in the morning, when the house was
hushed, I heard the tramp of men on the corridor : it was
the Secret Correctional Police.

" At five minutes past two, No. 9, young Dobkins, the
Quaker before mentioned, put his head out of his bed-
chamber door, but was thrust back by a sentinel posted
there, and told to mind his own business. . . . He had
heard piercing shrieks proceeding from No. 7.

" My Dear Sir, — The Police silently retired about
three in the morning, leaving Tuffskin flayed alive, and
myself burning with indignation at an insult which, though
it had fallen on Count Tuffskin's shoulders, had been in-
tended for me. Matilda Schouvoff — beautiful, beloved,
faithless Matilda — had rescued me from that peril : she
had got an inkling, on the previous evening, from the Police
Minister, her father, of the fate that was destined for me.

" It was pretended that I was a Eussian subject. I had
indeed accepted service with the Emperor — and of what
country am I a subject since that day when, a fugitive and
an exile, I shook oft' my country and my allegiance with the
bootless clods of Ballingarry ? — nevertheless, writhing at
the notion of the insult, I rushed away immediately after
breakfast, and sent up a note to our — I mean the English

minister. Sir H-m-lt-n S-m-r, intimating that the M

of B — m — desired to see him : his Excellency knew me as
a gentleman before I was an exile ; we have danced to-
gether at Almack's and the Tuileries many times, and
always lived on terms of the greatest cordiality.

" Sir H-m-lt-n said very fairly, * My good fellow, what
can I do for you ? you are no longer a Chieftain and gentle-
man of the United Kingdom ; or if you are, I must claim
you. I must claim you as a rebel, send you back to Ireland
for trial, when you will be transported to Van Diemen's
Land, where probably you will not act as certain friends of
yours have done.'

"I said if his Excellency meant Messrs. M. and N.,
though I might not possibly approve of their proceedings,
yet I was prepared to blow out the brains of any man who
questioned their strict honor, and so I tell Mr. Duffy to his
face here as I write — thousands of miles away from home
under the battlemented walls of Redoubt Kaleh !

" When his Excellency heard of Tuffskin's misadventure,
he burst out laughing as if the deuce was in him, and so did
that queer fellow his Secretary, who was in the room when



IMPORTANT FROM THE SEAT OF WAR. 407

our interview took place. I can see for my part nothing
comic in the transaction; however, as the bastinado had
been administered in private, as all these things are kept
dark in Petersburg, as Tuffskin to this day believes he got
the rattan on his private account, I agreed with my friends
the English diplomatists that it was best for me to make
no noise about the business, and to walk the streets as if
nothing had happened.

" That afternoon, about two o'clock, I was, standing be-
fore Jacob's the printseller's shop, talking and joking with
young Alexis Miroladowax : who should pass us in his
brown droschki, in which the etiquette is never to recognize
him, but the Emperor himself ! I happened to be cracking
with laughter at one of Alexis's stories (a very queer
one about my friend Count Cancrim) when his Majesty
passed.

" A man who had been flayed alive at two o'clock in the
morning shaking his sides with laughter on the Alexander
Platz, at two in the afternoon — here was a strange occur-
rence ! The Emperor looked at me as if I had been a ghost i
he turned quite livid when he saw me. I appeared to take
no notice, laughed and chatted on with Alexis, and pre-
tended to be looking at the brass statue of St. Gregorius
Nazianzenus, which stands in the Place.

" Gallant men never kiss and tell, so I leave such to im-
agine the rapturous meeting which took place that even-
ing in the blue saloon of the Winter Palace between me
and my lovely rescuer — the pressure of the hand, which,
though but momentary, causes the frame to thrill with hap-
piness — the rapid glance of the eye, more eloquent than a
thousand speeches. Oh, Matilda ! Can it be that you have
forgotten me so soon, and for a Qu ; but I am advanc-
ing matters — no woman could be fonder or truer than
Matilda was then.

" It was, as I have said, a Thursday evening, the night of
the Empress's weekly reception. Our Quaker friends had
come to take leave ; they were to depart indeed before it
was light the next morning, and I recollect Matilda asking
me why young Mr. Dobkins was not present, whom I had
introduced to her family, from which he had received great
and constant attention. The young Quaker is a man of
enormous wealth, and I recollect Matilda and myself count-
ing up, in roubles, the amount of the income which he re-
ceives in pounds sterling for his share of the business.



408 MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS.

"I laughed. I supposed Dobkins wanted to keep his
moustaches, and did not care to face his uncle, old Jedediah
Dobkins, who with some of the old members of the deputa-
tion lived with an old friend, a serious tallow merchant on
the English Quay.

" I went into the Imperial presence with the rest, and
made my bow to their Majesties. The dear Empress, I
thought, turned away her head from me with a very mourn-
ful expression, whereas the Autocrat looked as black as
thunder. I did not mind his black looks ; made my obei-
sance, and retired presently into the pink and silver draw-
ing-room, where Falconnet's silver bust of the Empress
Catherine stands, and where the Maids-of-Honor commonly
sit and have tea ; it is exceedingly good at Petersburg, as
everybody knows, and I drank two or three and twenty cups
whilst chattering with these charming girls.

" Presently I saw Matilda coming, with a look of great
anxiety in her face ; she beckoned me to speak to her, and
I followed her into the embrasure of the window, in which
the Cupid and Psyche stands looking out on the Tolstoi
Square.

"^Oh, my Mulliganovitch,' she said, ^my Nijni, my

Moujik, my Caviare, my M y my beautiful, my brave,

my best beloved, I have dreadful news for you.'

" * Speak, cushla machree na boclish,' says I (the Celtic
and the Slavonic dialects are very similar), seizing her
lovely hand, and pressing it to my beating waistcoat;
* speak, light of my eyes, and tell me what is the matter.'

" * You asked for passports for Prussia this morning at
the Police Office, and they were promised to you.'

" ^ They were, adored creature ; will you fly with me ? '

" * Oh, Mulliganovitch (such a heavenly expression of the
eyes here), you will never be allowed to depart to Prussia :
to-morrow at ten o'clock, somebody who tells me every-
thing — get away you jealous creature, and don't be jealous
of him, or doubt your poor little Matilda — informs me that
you will be seized and sent to Siberia : you are considered
as a naturalized Russian subject. The Emperor laughed
for a moment when he heard of poor Count Tuffskin being
mistaken for you. Oh, dear, dear Mulliganovitch, I could
not sleep all night for thinking of what might befall you ;
but after his laugh, he grew more angry than ever, and had
it not been for the Empress going on her knees to him this
very evening, the horrid operation would have been per-
formed on you.'



IMPORTANT FROM THE SEAT OF WAR. 409

"I ground my teeth, crunching between them the exe-
cration which otherwise had issued from my lips. To be
sent to Siberia — the thought was madness !

" ^ Ladies are not allowed to go there/ sobbed out Matilda,
divining the cause of my emotion; ^they will separate me
from my MuUiganovitch ; they will marry me to that horrid
tipsy Tuffskin/

" I don't know what I should have done in that moment
of grief and joy had not Matilda's mamma called her at
this very juncture, and left me to contemplate my fate, and
(to quote the beautiful words of General Wolfe) bitterly
think of the morrow.

" On board H. T. M.'s Ship the Mahmoudjee Kebobjee,

off Sebastopol, July 5th, 1854.

" My Dear Sir, — I returned to the H6tel d' Angleterre,
immersed in disagreeable thought, for it is never pleasant
to look on friends for the last time, more especially if you
are going away from a pleasant place on a confoundedly
disagreeable journey, as a trip in a chain-gang to Siberia
undoubtedly is ; most especially of all, if you are about to
part from a being so beautiful, beloved, and devoted as I
then thought Matilda Schouvoff. Beautiful ? yes ! De-
voted ? phoo ! Beloved ? ha ! ha ! — But I am advancing
matters.

"We had our usual company to supper, excepting of
course Tuffskin, who, for very good reasons, did not show,
and drank many a friendly bumper to our Quaker friends,
whose last night it was, and whose luggage lay piled in the
Hotel corridors, ready to be carried ofE to the steamer be-
fore dawn. Young Dobkins was particularly melancholy.
He has beautiful blue eyes, and a figure and an expression,
as I have previously stated, singularly like my own. The
young fellow's eyes, I remarked, began to fill with tears,
and he spoke with profound emotion of the kindness which
he had received from inhabitants of St. Petersburg, con-
trasting the splendor and elegance of the society there
with the humdrum routine of Godmanchester, Bristol, and
other cities whither his lot had led him, as a Quaker, a
manufacturer, and a man.

" I know the world pretty well, and when a young fellow
begins to blush, and shake, and sigh, and tremble in his
voice, and hang down his head, and rub his eyes with his
fist, I feel tolerably certain what is the matter. < Hullo,
my friend Broadbrim,' says I, ^ there's a woman in the case.
I see that in a jiffy.'

" Broadbrim gave a heave of his chest, a squeeze to my
hand, and demurely pleaded guilty to the soft impeach-
ment. A woman there was, as beautiful ! oh, as be-eu-ti-ful



IMPORTANT FROM THE SEAT OF WAR, 411

as an angel, lie gurgled out, concealing his emotion and a
part of his comely young countenance (confound it !) in a
frothing beaker of champagne — a woman — the loveliest
being in St. Petersburg, from whom he did not know how
he should tear himself away.

" ^ The loveliest being in St. Petersburg ! ' thought I ;
' no, no, my fine lad, that young person is disposed of else-
where,' naturally presumiilg that the young fellow had lost
his heart to some girl of the English factory, some hide-and-
tallow merchant's daughter, in his own shop-keeping, slop-
selling, square-toed walk of life.

" I have a feeling heart, and having been touched by love,
and frantic with passion, many many scores of times in my
life, I can feel another's woe under those painful and deli-
cate circumstances. I consoled honest Dobkins, therefore ;
I clapped him on the back ; returned squeeze for squeeze of
his hand, and pledged his lady-love in innumerable bumpers
of champagne, for which — poor satisfaction — I now con-
sole myself by thinking that the young rascal was left to
pay.

" As we were talking, Dobkins's servant brought him a
note, which he seized eagerly, read with glittering eyes and
flushing cheeks, over which he murmured a hundred gasps
and exclamations, and was about to kiss, had not my pres-
ence deterred him.

" ^ Kiss away, my boy,' said I ; ' I have osculated reams
of notepaper in my time, and know full well whom that
pretty little packet comes from.'

" ^ Do thee ? ' says he, blushing up to the temples.

" ^ Of course I do,' I answered with a laugh. * Dost thou
think, bashful Broadbrim ! that the ' — I protest I had
here very nearly written down my own name and title —
^ that Verax has never been in love with a pretty girl ? '

" ' Chief,' says he — for Chief I am, though my tribe is
wellnigh extinct, and a Chieftainship a mockery — ^ Chief,'
says he, ^ dost thee know that this letter concerns thee ; a
great danger menaces thee — exile, chains ; ' and in a low
whisper, so that the waiter should not hear, who was cutting
the string of the sixth bottle — ' Siberia ! '

" * Does the whole town know it ? ' cried I, ^ double dis-
tilled donkey that I was — is my disgrace the talk of even
the hemp and tallow merchants of the city ? '

" ' My letter,' says Dobkins, slowly, and with much agita
tion — the artful young hypocrite, I should like to wring

his neck, — ^my letter is from one who is a very good friend
to thee, who fears the dreadful fate that awaits thee in the
eternal snow ' — the canting young humbug — * who points
out the only way to avert the evil fortune — the way to free-
dom, the way to escape from thy tyrant, perhaps to revenge
thyself on him at some future day/

" ' Ha ! boy,' I exclaimed, strongly moved by the young
crocodile's words, for as I never told falsehood myself I am
slow to suspect it in another ; ' so thou knowest the fate that
menaces me, and hast found out means to avert it ; speak,
my friend ; whatever a man of courage may do I am ready
to attempt, in order to escape from a tyrant, and one day to
avenge my wrong.'

"^Easy, my good friend,' cries this young square-toes, this
arch sly-boots, ' we Quakers are of the peaceful sort ; here
is no question about revenge, but about escape, and that im-
mediately. Thee knowest that the gates of Petersburg are
shut against thee, and that thee may as well hope to escape
from the Autocrat as from death, when the day comes. A
way, however, there is, and but one, by which thee can put
thyself out of reach of the claws of this Eussian Eagle ;
and though I shall risk myself not a little, nevertheless, for
thy sake, and for the sake of those who are so interested in
thy welfare, I will abide the peril, so I may set thee free.
Our steamer, the John Bright, sails from the Potemkin
Quay at half past two o'clock this morning, when the tide
serves. The Friends have given orders to be waked at one,
which is now the hour. Thee must take my passports, thee
must shave off thy moustaches, and put on the broadbrim
and drab, which thee loves to laugh at, and so escape.'

" ^ Generous boy ! ' I exclaimed, gripping his hand like a
vise; 'and what will happen to you?' I was quite con-
founded by the seeming nobility of the young scoundrel's
self-sacrifice.

" ' Never thee mind that,' says Broadbrim. * How can I
help it if a rogue makes off with my coat, my hat, and my
passport ? I am a Briton, and my Ambassador will get me
another.' I took him to my heart, this loyal, this gallant,
this guileless, this affectionate heart, that beats with eter-
nal tenderness for the friend who does me a kindness —
that rankles with eternal revenge against the villain who
betrays me !

" I agreed to his proposal. To put on his great-coat and
broad hat was an easy matter ; though to part with my



IMPORTANT FROM THE SEAT OF WAR. 413

moustaches T own was difficult : can we help our little van-
ities ? our long bushy auburn-colored curly vanities ? I
rather would say. A more beautiful pair of moustaches
never decorated the lip of man. I loved them perhaps the
more because my Matilda loved them. I went up to my
chamber, and was absent a few minutes.

"When I returned, Dobkins started back. 'Gracious
heavens ! ' said he, and looked positively quite pale, — * gra-
cious heavens,' says he, ' what an alteration ! '

" Altered I was indeed. I had taken ofE my splendid uni-
form of an unattached colonel of Russian Cavalry — yellow,
with pink facings, and the Black Russian Spread Eagle
embroidered tastefully on the back — and put on a snufE-
colored suit of Dobkins's, which I found in his room. No. 10.
My face was shaved as clean as a baby's. I had a broad-
brimmed hat on. I placed in the Quaker's hand an enve-
lope, sealed with a royal 'scutcheon that once flamed in the
van of Erin's battle ; it contained my moustaches. I am
not ashamed to own that the tear bedewed my manly cheek,
as I bade him deliver the packet to the princess Matilda
Schouvoff.

" The young villain rushed up into his room, and put on
my uniform, which fitted him to a nicety, and I painted him
a pair of moustaches with one of the burnt champagne
corks, of which a half dozen were lying on the table : you
would really have thought it was myself as you looked at
him. Ah! Fatal resemblance! Ah! Sorrow that throws

" Six hours afterwards the John Bright steamer was be-
fore Cronstadt, and it was not until we were out of reach of
the guns of that fortress (which I have a certain plan for
silencing) that the friends of the Peace Deputation were
aware that I, and not their young companion, was on board.



" I did not care, for good reasons, to go to London ; but
as soon as we got to Dantzig, put myself into the railroad,
and betook myself to Paris, where my old friend, the Em-
peror Napoleon the Third, received me with his usual hos-
pitality. In several interviews with his Majesty, I laid be-
fore him the fullest information regarding the military and
pecuniary resources of the Russian empire which has ever
yet, as I believe, found its way out of those immense domin-

ions. What I told the French monarch (I confess myself a
friend to despots, and an enemy to philosophers and prat-
ers) — what information I had the good fortune to convey
to him I shall not, of course, publish here. My plans, were
they followed, would burst in thunder upon the crumbling
battlements of Cronstadt, and hurl into mid-air the ships
and arsenals of Sebastopol. I fear other counsels than
mine may be followed.

" St. Arnaud and I had a dispute long ago, when he was
in a very different situation in life. With the English com-
manders I cannot communicate, owing to my peculiar posi-
tion, and the Ballingarry affair. It was that unlucky busi-
ness likewise which prevented my friend The Emperor of
the French from giving me a command over troops which
were to act in conjunction with the forces of the English
Queen. He offered me Algeria, but I preferred active ser-
vice against Romanoff, and the Colonel of Bashi-Bazouks
has already put a shot or two into the proud wings of the
Eussian Eagle.

" If anything was wanting to sharpen the edge of my
hatred against him, against Russia, against men and women,
against Quakers especially, it was a paragraph which my
kind friend, the Emperor Napoleon, showed to me one after-
noon, as we were sitting in the Pavilion Marsan, talking
over Russia and the war. I was translating for him — and
I think I have said that I speak the language perfectly —
some of the lying bulletins out of the Petersburg gazettes,
in which his Majesty and his British allies are abused in a
most vulgar and outrageous manner, when glancing down a
column of fashionable intelligence I came to the following
paragraph : —

" * Conversion of an English Quaker to the Orthodox
Faith, — A young Quaker nobleman, of the highest birth,
whose family has devoted itself for some time past to
commercial pursuits, whereby he has realized, an immense
fortune, has quitted the lamentable errors and benighted
faith under which most of his countrymen labor, and has
professed himself a convert to the only true and orthodox
religion. It is M. Dobkinski's intention to establish him-
self in our capital, and his Majesty has graciously awarded
him the order of St Andrew of the second class, the rank
of Colonel, and the permission to marry Matilda, daughter
of Police President Prince Schouvoff.'

Napoleon, * you look a little pale : ' and no wonder ; I did
look a little pale, though I did not inform my imperial

ScvTAiii, Tvadag.
Y DEAR SIR, — In

order not to be recog-
nized by the 33d boys,
whom I knew intimately
at Dimdalk (I hereby
present my best regarda
to Colonel Blake and the
officers of that regiment,
who have the best mesa
of any regiment in Her
Britannic Majesty's ser-
. vice), and to keep out ol
; the way of unpleasant
■ rencontres with General
ird E-gl-n, General
H. R. H. the Duke of
C-mbr dge and other acquaintances of happier years, I have
taken the precaution since my arrival here of dyeiug my face,
beard, and hands, wearing a plaster over my nose and right
eye. I use Burgess's walnut ketchup for my face and hands
in preference to Indiasoy, which I employed at first; but for
which the flies and wasps, which abound in this country,
have a great liking.

"Yesterday, as I was having an audience of the Sultan's
mother, the dear Sultana Valideh, a whacking big hornet^
attracted by the confounded soy, settled close on my nose,
stung me, and occasioned atrocious agonies. Of course I
had to grin as if nothing was the matter, and continue the
conversation, which was most interesting. When the Sul-
tana left us I Could bear the pain no longer, but rubbed my
nose, and tore off the plaster which covered that and my
eye.



IMPORTANT FROM THE SEAT OF WAR. 417

" It was so swollen that the gallant and excellent Eng-
lish Pr-nce, who made one at our consultation, very likely
could not recognize me. At any rate he did not. A
dancing dervish (a most holy man, and great favorite of
the Sultana's) fetched some leaves out of the garden, and,
having chewed them, fomented my feature, which speedily
resumed its own classic shape. Mem, — To inquire what
the plant is, and send some to dear friends at home ;
where a fellow of spirit may often get a swelled eye still,
praised be luck ! — at elections, fairs, and so forth.

" The splendid proposals which her Highness made me
(in private) on the part of her imperial son, of course, are
out of the question. The young Princess Nijoona (for
those who like that style of beauty) is lovely certainly.
She is but sixteen, and must weigh as many stone. Her eye-
brows meet. Her complexion is very fair (though I must
say I think she is painted). Her teeth are not good, owing
to the quantity of sweetmeats they take. When I go to
see the Sultana Valideh I am half choked with the lumps
of sugar-candy which I am obliged to swallow whenever I
say anything witty, and that, of course, is at every other
observation. It seemed Nijoona remarked me as I was
riding in the Valley of the Sweet Waters (hers then must
have been the hand which held out the three rhododen-
drons and the polyanthus from behind the pink and silver
curtains of that emerald green aroba !) and was pleased
with my personal appearance. Nijoona I thou art not the
first, by long chalks, who has been charmed by this figure !

" Wishing to soothe every lady's disappointment as much
as possible — when a hint was given me in a certain august
quarter — I told one of the few falsehoods which I have
uttered in my life, and said I was married in my own coun-
try. And the upshot of this silly fib was to show how use-
less it is to lie.

" The young lady's imperial grandmother did not seem to
consider my previous marriage an objection. ' All that we
shall require is that Nijoona shall be the first wife ; and if
the second makes any objections, my dear Colonel,' the
Sultana-Mother said, in her peculiar arch way, 'there is
plenty of sacking in the bazaars, and the Bosphorus is very
deep.'

" To have the rank of Pasha, and a palace at Constan-
tinople and at Therapia, with fifty millions of piastres
down, and jewels to a still larger amount ; to divide the

command with Omar Pasha ; and, at the end of the war, to
have the hereditary pashalic of Syria, with palaces built
for me at Jerusalem, Damascus, and Beyrout — these, I
confess, were handsome ofEers, not to be attributed so much
to my merit, no doubt, as to the passion which young Ni-
ioona had conceived for me : who is, as is well known, her
imperial father's favorite, to whom his Highness can refuse
nothing.

" The poor thing actually tried to fascinate me by her
simple accomplishments, and sang me one or two songs to
her guitar. Asking me if I was also a musician, I took up
the little instrument and sang, 'Who fears to speak of
Ninety-Eight ? ' (out of my friend Duffy's paper) in a way
which brought tears into the eyes of the Pr-nc-ss-s. No
wonder they were affected as the poor Exile sang !

" But marriage and turning Turk was quite another paire
de bottes. When Nijoona went weeping out of the room,
led away by her maids, and her grandmother put the ques-
tion to me point-blank, I was about to answer point-blank,
No ! but a look from my friend, the dancing dervish, put me
on my guard. ' Madam,' said I, ' I must ask your R-y-l
permission to have some conversation with my reverend
friend here regarding the two faiths, and if he can convince
me — then, indeed ! ' She is a very warm partisan of her
creed ; and gave me a couple of little tracts, ' The Washer-
woman of Therapia,' and ' The Boatman of the Bosphorus,'
which, she said, had converted a great number of Poles and
Hungarians, and left me after my promising to study these
works.

" ' Unless you intend to come round, Mulligoon,' said my
friend, the dervish, ' you had better put some distance be-
tween you and the princess. She is a fiery little creature,
and will have you strangled or poisoned as sure as your
name is what it is.'

" So it seems there is to be no rest for me — not in Dub-
lin, not in London, not in Petersburg, not in Constan-
tinople ! Finding that the coach was going to Varna that
afternoon (and most uncomfortable conveyances those Turk-
ish stage-coaches are), I took a place for myself and my
servant in it, with letters to the Governor of Silistria. And
by the time that the clock of the Mosque of Saint Sophia
struck thirteen (the hour at which the Sultana-Mother had
appointed me) tne next day, I had left Varna, and was on
horseback on the road to Silistria.

" You now understand why my death was announced on
the very first day of the siege of this place ; a piece of news
which put poor Nijoona into a dreadful fury ; she was so
enraged to think I had escaped her vengeance. I do not
envy Nobbi Pasha, whom she has married since by order
of her imperial father. Nobbi is a quiet man, and she
leads him and his family the deuce's own life.

" The Governor of SUistria welcomed me with that dis-
tinction which I am accustomed to receive from brave men.
Having been just obliged to hang the colonel of a regiment
of most refractory Bashi-Bazouks, the Pasha was pleased
to offer me the vacant command, which I accepted; and
when I had partaken of coffee and pipes, given my views
of the affairs of Europe, the advance of the Russians, etc.,
to His Excellency, a person of the highest distinction,
greatest bravery, and most aristocratic manners, he wrote a
line by an aide-de-camp ; and mounting horses, which were
provided for us, I rode down to the place by the Mosque of
Sultan Selim, a little to the left of the Bakers' quarter of
the Old Bazaar, where my Bashi-Bazouks were quartered.

" A more drunken and ferocious set of vagabonds eyes
never lighted upon me. In the centre of the place they
had struck up their standard with a hideous Russian head,
surmounted by its cocked hat on the top. The tom-toms,
kettle-drums, j in jails, and other music of the regiment were
around this. The men were scattered here and there, some
smoking, many intoxicated, and under a rude canopy sat a
dozen of officers, of whom a gigantic woolly-haired mulatto
seemed the chief ; he had a skin of wine by his side as big
as a portmanteau ; and was gnawing a leg of lamb with his
long fangs, holding it up with his huge fists, and glaring at
me over the meat.

" ^ Are you the Bimbashi ? ' says I — ' are you, gentlemen,
the Captains and Lieutenants of this pretty regiment ? '

" * Yes,' they replied, seasoning their answer with curses
in a hundred dialects.

" ^ Then stand up ! ' I roared out, ' whilst I read my com-
mission,' — and accordingly taking that document from the
aide-de-camp (who, I must say, trembled like a mould of
jelly), I kissed the paper, held it to my forehead three
times, and then read it to the officers and men.

" ' Ho ! ho ! ho ! and so you are the Colonel, are you ? '
yelled the Bimbashi, laying his leg of lamb down and spring-
ing up, rubbing the gravy off his mouth with his great brawny

arm. — ' A stranger ! and a Giaour, and you are come to
be set over us, are you ? Keep the gates, you sentinels !
Take that Eussian's head off the flag, Ensign ! '

" ' Who sides with the Sultan, and who with the Major ? '
says I.

" ' We propose that the promotion goes with the regi-
ment,' roared out the officers.

" ' Where are the non-commissioned officers ? ' says I.
Seven or eight of them were standing apart as I saw. * Let
the men fall in ! ' I roared. * Captains, go to your companies.
Major ! ' —

" What I was going to say to him does not matter ; for
the ruffian fired a shot at me, and then sent the pistol fly-
ing at my head.

" It knocked down the poor aide-de-camp who was with
me — upon which, seeing I had to do with nine ruffians, of
course I produced my Revolvers, one of Colt's and one of
Handcock's, regarding the respective merits of which there
has been some question.

" The practice, as I take it, is pretty equal. With the
Colt I shot three captains, two lieutenants, missing No.
6, the ensign ; — with the Handcock I potted two ensigns,
a captain, a lieutenant, and finally my friend the major,
sending a ball into his great mouth, and stopping his horrid
language for the future towards his colonel and your

" FoBT OB Abab Tabia, TAuridag.

"Dear Sir, — I resume my pen, and continue my ac-
count of our siege. I accompany the MS. with drawings,
which you will please to have copied by proper persons
at home. The one I have hastily dashed off on this page
represents myself just now with a little incident that hap-
pened. I give you my honor I was so tired after twenty-
three hours in the saddle, or in the trenches, that I did not
care to remove the shell, but let it blaze away at its leisure.
It only killed nineteen men. I thought a few pictures of
myself might please the girls at home ; and you will take
care the artist you employ makes me handsome enough,
or, if I survive this siege, woe be to him on my return
home !

"Friday. After dispatching that little business with the

vacant posts : reserving the place of Major for my faithful

put out of temper. My temper, when I am pleased, is often
very fine.

" Inspected the defunct Bimbashi's quarters, and selected
out of his stock such things as suited me. The late villain
appears to have had an appetite for plunder : I have the
less remorse in having suppressed him. I found in his
rooms thirteen very handsome suits of clothes, of different
but handsome patterns. Selected for every-day wear a pink
pelisse, yellow trousers, and a shawl round my fez : for Sun-
days a light blue Cashmere ditto ditto, Shulwars striped
white and crimson, pea-green morocco boots with silver
spurs ; and another equally elegant dress for change ; — the
rest I distributed among my men. Besides the clothes I
found, among the villain's effects : —

"A desk, marked Mr. J. T. Jones, containing £2,000 of
circular notes of Coutts', payable to John Thomas Jones,
Esq., with the circular letter containing Mr. John Thomas
Jones's signature. I warn Mr. J.'s family that they can
have the desk back again, containing, —

" Two quires of Bath note-paper.

"Eighteen letters, one containing a lock of hair, and
signed your ever ever faithful Anna Maria.

" Jones's journal and fifteen of his inn bills (it appears
he kept his accounts with much regularity).

" A box of Cockle's compound Aitibilious Pills, of which
I own to having given six one evening to one of my Cap-
tains, Crummy Effendi, who was indisposed, and

" The circular letter containing Jones's signature. The
notes, I am sorry to say, have been taken by some one, and
were cashed by Messrs. Nephelegeretes & Co., of Pera, upon
a rather clumsy forgery of Jones's signature.

" In the poor Major's kit I further found : —

" A brace of silver-mounted pistols, and a yataghan, with
a case of gold, as I first thought, covered with turquoises.
If the late Bimbashi, as I have too much reason to suspect,
robbed some innocent family of this yataghan, thinking it
was gold, the villain was grievously disappointed, for I
could only get 500 piastres for the knife when I sold it at
Adrianople.

" Proceeding in my perquisitions, I discovered : —

" A worsted stocking, containing a Russia leather Pocket-
book with 3,673 paper roubles of Russia, and a bag of 996
silver roubles, chiefly of the Emperor Alexander's reign —
which — I mean the paper roubles — I gave to the Com-

mandant of Silistria. The silver I thought proper to re-
tain : and make no doubt that the scoundrel I had just ex-
terminated had been in league with the enemy. Also I
found: —

" A portmanteau, marked * solid leather/ containing two
dozen shirts, marked J. T. J.

"Stockings, collars, and handkerchiefs with the same
mark.

" Six cakes of brown Windsor soap.

"And a silver-mounted dressing-case — rather a hand-
some thing — the bottle-stoppers, etc., marked J. T. J.,
with a lion rampant for a crest. The maker. West, in St.
James's Street.

" But how the deuce can I tell to whom a portmanteau
belongs marked only ^ Warranted Solid Leather ' ? Of
course k la guerre, it is k la guerre. I found the linen most
comfortable, and the stockings and slippers very pleasant
for a change, when I came in wet and weary out of the
trenches. That Major certainly had robbed somebody, and
was a lawless villain, whose life was rightly sacrificed to his
cupidity.

" Saturday. Paraded my regiment, and gave them four-
teen hours under arms. Had to chastise seven or eight of
them, showing them que je n'entendais pas la plaisanterie.
Confiscated a goose and a lamb, which our villain had robbed
out of the bazaar, and sent the giblets back to the family.
On this day we received information in Silistria that a
Russian corps was advancing out of the Dobrudsha upon
Rassova.

" Monday, My quarters are pretty good in the house of
the Greek Papa Polyphloesboeos. His wife Boopis must
have been good-looking, his daughter Rhododactylos is
extremely so. Sat with them, and drank rakee, whilst the
old gentleman was at church. Sang ^ Who fears to speak
of Ninety-Eight ? ' and ^ The Shan Van Voght ' to the
ladies, who were affected to tears.

" After I had done singing, pretty little Rhododactylos
took the instrument, and improvised a plaintive ballad re-
specting the late events with my regiment, beginning

lamb, the old man dined on the flaps of bread which we
had used for plates: and I left the old monster actually

" Tuesday, Annoyed all night by the old Papa's snor-
ing. Finding he has a very comfortable bed, ordered it to
my room. Went out with my Bazouks to the bridge of
Routsehouk, where we found the advanced guard of the
enemy. Charged them nine times, but were beaten back by
the Russians, with a loss of thirty-nine of ours killed, and
seventy - eight wounded. All things considered, however,
my men behaved very well. Ehododactylos was a good deal
agitated, and her mother, Boopis Potnia, delighted at my
return. The old Papa seemingly not glad to see me.

macintosh I took from the young fellow of the Lobski
Hussars of great use and comfort. Poor fellow ! He too
very likely had been in England. The cloak is marked Pic-
cadilly. Such is life.

"18. The enemy, who has been establishing batteries
upon the islands and the left bank, opened his fire this day
from noon until night. Polyphloesboeos, in great pertur-
bation, took up his residence in the cellar, where I did not
grudge the old chap fuddling himself with Cyprus wine.
His comrade, the Papa Dolicoschios called — as he was
talking his head knocked off by a cannon-ball — broke china
in a comer cupboard: his hand still holding his beard,
which was uncommonly fine, the other his large umbrella.

" 19. The enemy opened his trenches at about two Eng-
lish miles off our lines — his left towards Arab Tabia, his
right on the Danube. Slept as sound as a roach on the old
Papa's mattress, though the Eussians never ceased firing
from sunset until the morning of the 20th, when his first
parallel was completed. The enemy's chasseurs trying to
establish themselves on the height opposite Arab Tabia,
the Bashi-Bazouks and Albanians drove them back. Little
finger carried off by a Mini^ ball. Gallant conduct of Ka-
ragooz Beg, killed a Russian Colonel, and put on his boots
in the face of the enemy. Poor poor little Rhododactylos !
Sadly put out by accident to my little finger. — Two Cir-

Every one of their balls hit. Twenty-four pound shot
knocked letter I was reading out of my hand : and plumped
into . the bosom of Hokim-Aga, Commandant's Aide-de-
camp. Had order in his pocket — from a certain high
quarter — to shoot me, and reward of 1,000,000 sequins to
bring my head to Constantinople. Did not tell poor little
Ehododactylos for fear of alarming the timid little flutter-
ing affectionate creature ! — Mem, Mrs. Polyphloesboeos
begins to look very sulky at me.

" 24. Provisions are growing rather scarce at my quarters,
and old Polyphloesboeos begins to grumble. This evening

only touch a little morsel. Young Spiridion Polymetis,
whom I have appointed Lieutenant vice Borborygmos, who
ran away disgracefully last night, has been useful in these
latter days carrying my messages to or from the Commander
of the place. In the sally we made last night, Spiridion
rode back very good-naturedly into the enemy's column for
my umbrella ; it was the old priest's, and not having drawn
my sword, I had been constrained to use it in order to poke
out a Cossack Colonel's eye who was making himself very
officious in front.

^^Mem, I am growing rather rich in cash. Besides 39
piastres which I brought with me, I have : —

"A portmanteau of handsome clothes, as above, value
say £80.

" 969 silver roubles.

" £2,000, which came to me by the laws of war.

" A gold snuff-box with the portrait of the Emperor set
in diamonds, and the order of the Saracen's Head of the
second class in brilliants also, sent by his Imperial Majesty
to Major-General Baron Slabbers, whom I slew in the sec-
ond attack on the 22d.

" Twelve silver-gilt candlesticks, and a couple of statues,
of an ecclesiastical pattern, I confess : and some gold-lace
vestments of which the old Papa Polyphloesboeos has made
me a present (very unwillingly) out of his church. He may
have a hesitation, but I have none, in taking possession of
the bullion employed in the Cathedral of these schismatics.

" A gold bowl, a picture frame ditto ditto, and a silver
armchair which Spiridion was instrumental in procuring for
me from the abbot of the Armenian Convent hard-by. I
shall value these at even more than the bazaar prize, as they
were the means of saving the Eeverend man's life : indeed,
I should have hanged him had he not given them up.

" A bag of loose diamonds, emeralds, and a silver soup-
ladle of English manufacture given to me with the grateful
tear of a Jewish family.

pleased to compliment me, said he would send my name to

affair of the Jew, who was making a deuce of a disturb-
ance.

" The affair last night was very hot. My arm this morn-
ing is black and blue from lifting iron. The Eussians had
actually entered the redoubt and cut down our artillery men
at their guns, when the Bashi-Bazouks luckily arriving gave
a different turn to affairs. We may expect a great attack
in a day or two. My prisoner says that Marshal Paskie-
witsch was in such a rage as to kick the Major-General at
the head of the column.

" 27. Three tremendous attacks on Arab Tabia took place
to-night. The first, under the command of General Coimt
Slutz of the Alexander Regiment, was very nearly doing
for us. They came on in spite of the fire of our guns, their
drums beating, their officers in the front waving their hats
and cursing and swearing in the most frightful manner.
The Russians actually clambered through the embrasures
and over the guns. Count Slutz, a very stout man, in jack-
boots, was rammed up in an embrasure against a Paixhan
gun, and there I confess I prodded him. After his death
the survivors of the attacking column fell back in much
disorder. This must have been at 10.35 by the late Count's
repeater.

" At 11.22 p. M. the gallant foe returned in still greater
force ; they did not fire a shot until they were close upon
us, and I heard a voice calling out — ' Three hundred thou-
sand silver roubles and the Order of Saint Anne, second
class, for the man who brings in Mulliganoff dead or alive ! '
I thought I knew the voice. ' Ha, my boy ! ' I roared out
from the bastion. ' Ha, Tuff skin, my boy ! How did you
like the bastinado at the Hdtel d'Europe ? ' Indeed it was
poor Tuffskin, who had arrived only that morning at the
army. He will never suffer the cat-of -nine-tails more. It
was the fortune of war, and now he is no more I can do
justice to a gallant enemy. I gave his ear-rings to little

a fire so murderous that 452 men were killed, and 2,706
wounded, by the first discharge. We gave them a second

impetuosity, many of my fellows were actually drowned
with the Eussians. I had marked and seized an old officer
who had been making himself particularly conspicuous, and
having broken my sword was pummelling him most severely
with the handle about the face and ribs, when he cried out
in very good French, ' Tenez, Mulliganoff ! Je me rends.
Je suis le Marechal Prince Paskie ' — But I heard no
more, for a shot entered my shoulder and down I dropped.

"I had to walk home five miles with a bullet in my
shoulder ; and did not reach my quarters till 7 o'clock a. m.
What a scream of delight little Ehododactylos gave at be-
holding me ! They were eating a piece of horse for break-
fast ; for provisions are getting scarce. I took my share of
the chivaMc meal ; and then had the conical ball extracted,
which had given me much annoyance. Prisoners who came

had received some severe contusions the night before, and
that Prince Gortschakoff had resumed the command of the
siege.

enemy was so hot that not less than twenty-nine cannon-
balls and four shells fell into my room, which burst there
and filled the place with smoke. I could not move, as the
surgeon had forbidden me to stir, even taking away my
pantaloons, so as to prevent the possibility of my quitting
my apartment. In the intervals of the firing my charming
Ehododactylos was so attentive and kind to the poor
wounded Bashi-Bazouk, that my heart melted towards the
dear girl. I offered my hand, on condition, of course, that
she would separate from the Greek schism ; and the blush-
ing young creature gave me her own rosy fiiigers in reply.

" July 1, The siege is raised. The Eussians are in full
retreat, my Bashi-Bazouks after them. I am so weak that
I cannot move from my bed. Cowards and detractors have
been blackening my character to Sammi Pasha, who has
now the command of Silistria, and I am a prisoner — I who
saved Silistria !

" 2. Ehododactylos was allowed to come in to me with a
little calves'-foot jelly, which she had been making. I told
the dear girl where I had secreted my property ; viz., in a
hole under the pumpkin bed in the garden of the house,
where poor old Polyphloesboeos discovered me investing

some of my property on the 23d. I was in the hole, spade
in hand, digging, and thereby saved my life ; for a round
shot took off Polyphloesboeos's head just over me : and the
poor man thus paid for his curiosity.

this day. The sentry was taken off yesterday, and I re-
ceived my order of Nisham from the English officer here,
who says my conduct is overlooked — I think it is over-
looked indeed! — in consequence of my gallantry. The
house being empty, I went down to the garden, where I
kept my things.

" O Ehododactylos ! woman, faithless woman ! Would
you believe it ? I only found the desk and papers marked
J. T. Jones ; every other single item of my property has
been taken away, except a boot-jack, an old coat, and a pair
of very old trousers, and I was told by the clerk of the
Greek Chapel, that Ehododactylos and Spiridion were mar-
ried yesterday morning, and that they left Silistria the
same afternoon for Bulgaria, in an aroba very heavily
laden. Spiridion was in a pink pelisse, red-striped trou-
sers, and pea-green boots. Ehododactylos, the clerk said,
blazed in diamonds : and unless you accept the bill I have
drawn upon you through Messrs. Ornithes of this city, I am
actually a penniless

THE FLYING DUKE.

November, 1843.

" O AY, whose can yonder chariot be,
1^ That thunders on so fast ?
And who was he that sat within ?
I marked him as he past."

" 'Twas Arthur, Duke of Wellington,

Who in that chariot sat.
All in his martial cloak, and in

His proudly-plumed cocked-hat."

" Not Arthur, Duke of Wellington,

That poster fierce could be.
Nor yet a living nobleman :

Some Demon Duke is he."

" 'Twas he — to Folkestone he is bound,

To town by rail to wend ;
Wheref rom to Windsor he must hie,

A Council to attend."

With whizz and whistle, snort and puff,

The Duke is borne to town.
Nor stops until near London Bridge

The train hath set him down.

There waits a Brougham on Wellington :

To Apsley House he flies.
Whereat a messenger in red

Doth meet his Grace's eyes.



448 VERSES.

" How now, thou scarlet messenger !

Thy tidings briefly tell."
" The Queen invites your grace to dine

To-morrow."

« Very well"

To Paddington by cab, to Slough

By steam — away, away !
To Windsor, thence, he goes by fly ;

But there he must not stay —

For that his grace at Walmer hath

A tryst this night to keep ;
And he hath warned his serving-men

He shall be back to sleep.

The Council's o'er ; back posts his grace,

As fast as fast might be.
Hurrah ! hurrah ! well speeds the Duke —

He'll be in time for tea.

The morrow comes ; again away

The noble Duke is gone
To Folkestone, and to London Bridge,

And thence to Paddington.

" Away, away to Paddington,

As fast as ye can drive ;
'Twixt eight and nine the Queen doth dine ;

Be there by half-past five."

Fast have they fled, right fleetly sped,

And Paddington is won.
" How, office-swain, about the train ? ''
'Tis just this instant gone."

" Your grace, we just have missed the ti*ain.

It grieveth me to say."
"To Apsley House!" then cried the Duke,

"As quickly as you may."

The loud halloo of " Go it, you ! "

Beneath the gas-light's glare,
O'er wood and stone they rattle on,

As fast as they can tear.



THE FLYING DUKE. 449

On, on they went, with hue and cry,

Until the Duke got home.
The axle-trees on fire well nigh.

The horses in a foam.

Out stepp'd the Duke, serene and cool.

And calmly went upstairs,
And donn'd the dress, the which, at Court,

He generally wears.

"Windsor I may not reach in time

To make my toilet there ;
So thus the hour I will employ,

Which I, perforce, must spare.

"What is't o'clock?" "Your grace, near seven."

" Then bear me hence again ;
And mark me — this time take good care

You do not miss the train."

Off, off again, the coachman drives.

With fury fierce and fell,
'Mid whoop and shout from rabble rout.

And oath, and scream, and yell.

To right and left a way they cleft

Amid the bustling throng ;
While, meteor-like, the carriage-lamps

Flash'd as they flew along.

Hurrah ! Hurrah ! the station's nigh.

"What ho, there ! Shout amain !
Here comes the Duke, he's going down ;

Give word to stop the train."

The engineer and stoker hear ;

Duke Arthur takes his place ;
Behold him now, on way to Slough,

Borne at a whirlwind's pace.

" At Slough who stops ? " His Grace out pops,

His ticket is resigned,
"To Windsor haste, like .felon chased,

Or I shall be behind."

In banquet-hall ; and of them all

MR. SMITH AND MOSES. 451



ME. SMITH AKD MOSES.

March, 1848.

A VETERAN GENT, just stepped out of a boat,
r\. In a tattered old hat and a ragged pea-coat.
Appeared at a shop whither many folks run.
And that was the Palace of Moses and Son.

A respectable dame with the mariner went.
Most likely the wife of this veteran gent,
And the eyes of the pair were excited with won-
der on seeing the mansion of Moses and Son.

" IVe looked upon many a palace before,
But splendor like this, love, I never yet sor ! "
This party exclaimed. " What a great sum of mon-
ey it sure must have cost Messrs. Moses and Son ! '^

In the language of France his good lady replied,
" This house is well known through the universe wide ;
And you, my dear Philip, to seed having run,
Had better refit with E. Moses and Son."

E. Moses stepped forth with a bow full of grace.
Inviting the couple to enter his place :
He thought they were poor — but the poor are not done,
And the rich are not fleeced by E. Moses and Son.

" What clothes can I serve you to-day, my good man ? '^
E. Moses exclaimed : " You shall pay what you can j
The peer or the peasant, we suit every one ;
Republicans true are E. Moses and Son."

The pea-coated gent at that word made a start.
And looked nervously round at the goods of our mart:
" A vest, coat, and trousers, as soon as they're done,
I want, sHl vous plait. Messieurs Moses and Son.



452 VERSES.

^^1 once was a king, like the monarch of Boom,

But was forced from my throne and came off in a Br ^m ;

And in such a great hurry, from P-r-s I run,
I forgot my portmanteau, dear Moses and Son."

" Dear sir," we exclaimed, " what a lucky escape ! "
So one brought the patterns, another the tape ;
And while with our patterns his " peepers " we stun,
The gent is quick measured by Moses and Son.

The clothes when complete we direct in a hurry —
" — Smith, Esquire, at Prince Leopold's, Glaremont, in Sur-
rey."
The cloth was first-rate, and the fit such a one
As only is furnished by Moses and Son.

As he paces the valley or roams in the grove.
All cry, " What a very respectable cove ! "
How changed in appearance from him who late run
From Paris to refuge with Moses and Son.

Now who was this " veteran gent," sirs, E. Moses,
Although he may "guess," yet he never discloses.
• Do you wish to know more, gents ? if you do, why then run
To Aldgate and ask of E. Moses and Son.



THE FRODDYLENT BUTLER. 463



THE FEODDYLENT BUTLEE.

February^ 1849.

Mr. Punch, Sir, — The abuv is the below ritten Pome,
on a subjee of grate delicasy, wich as a butler, I feel it a
disgrase to the cloth that any man calling hisself a butler
should go for to git wind on false pretences, and such wind
(as reported in the papers of Tuesday last), from Rich-
mond ; and in justice to self and feller servants have ex-
pressed my feelins in potry, wich as you ave prevously ad-
mitted to your entertainin columns pomes by a futman (and
also a pleaceman), I think you ave a right to find a plaice
for a pome by a butler, wich I beg to subscribe myself your
constant reder.

John Corks.

14 Luahington Place West, Belgravy,



Tb



T'S all of one John George Montresor,

And Briggs, Esquire, his master kind;
is retch, all for his privat plesure.
Did f roddylently order wind.



To Mister Ellis, Richmond, Surrey,
Were Briggs, Esquire, he did reside,

This wicked John druv in a urry.
On June the fust and tenth beside.

And then, this mene and shabby feller
To Mister Ellis did remark,

Briggs ad gone out and took the cellar
Kee away across the Park ;

And cumpny comeng on a suddent.
Ad stayed to dine with Missis B.,

Whereby in course the butler cooden't
Get out the wind without the kee.



454 VERSES.

So Missis B. she would be werry

Much obliged if e'd send in
Arf a dozen best brown sherry,

And single bottel 'Ollans gin.

But this was nothink but a story as
This wicked butler went and told,

Whereby for nothink to get glorious,
Wich so he did, and grew more bold.

Until, at last grown more audashus,
He goes and orders, wat d'ye think ?

He goes and orders, goodness grashus,
Marsaly, wind no gent can (&ink.

It wasn't for his private drinkin —
For that he'd Briggses wine enuff —

But, wen the sherry bins was sinkin
He filled 'em with this nasty stough.

And Briggs, Esquire, at is own tabel
(To rite such things my art offends)

Might ave to drink, if he was abul,
Marsaly wind, hisself and fren(^ !

But praps John ne'er to tabel brort it.
And used it in the negus line ;

Or praps the raskal, when he bort it.
Knew Briggs was not a judge of wind.

At all ewents, all thro' the seson
This villin plaid these orrid games.

For butlers to commit such treson,
I'm sure it is the wust of shames.

But masters, tho soft, has there senses.
And roges, tho sharp, are cotcht at last ;

So Briggs, Esquire, at last commenses
To find his wind goes werry fast.

Once, when the famly gev a party,

Shampain, in course, the bankwet crown'd;

And Briggs, Esquire, so kind and arty.
He ordered John to and it round.



THE FRODDYLBNT BUTLER. 456

No wind in general's drunk more quicker,
But now his glass no gent would drane ;

When Briggs, on tasting, found the licker
Was British arf-a-crown Shampain I

That they'd not drink it was no wunder,

A dredful look did Briggs assoom,
And ordered, with a voice of thunder,

The retched butler from the room.

Then, rushin edlong to the cellar,

Eegardless if he broke is shins.
He found wot tricks the wicked feller

Had been a playin with the binns.

Of all his prime old sherry, raelly
There wasent none to speke oi there,

And Mr. Ellis's Marsaly
Was in the place the sherry were.

Soon after that the wicked feller's
Crimes was diskivered clear and clene,

By the small akount of Mr. Ellis,
For lickers, twenty pound fifteen.

And, not content with thus embezzlin
His master's wind, the skoundrel had

The Eichmond tradesmen all been chizzlin,
An' a doin' every think that's bad.

Whereby on Toosday, Janwry thirty.

As is reported in the Times,
He wor ad up for his conduc dirty.

And dooly punished for his crimes.

So masters, who from such base fellers
Would keep your wind upon your shelves,

This int accept — If you ave cellars,
Always to mind the kee yourselves.
