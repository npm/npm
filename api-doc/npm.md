npm(3) -- node package manager
==============================

## SYNOPSIS

    npm.commands.<command>([args])

## DESCRIPTION

npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.  It puts
modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency
conflicts intelligently.

It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases.
Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node
programs.

Run `npm help` to get a list of available commands.

## INTRODUCTION

Since you're looking at this man page, you are probably wanting to integrate
npm into your fantastic program.

Every time you use npm, you must call npm.load() with an object hash of
command-line configs. After that, each of the functions are accessible in the
commands object: `npm.commands.<cmd>`  Check out `npm help config` or
`man npm-config` for all available options.

All commands on the command object take an **array** of positional argument
**strings**. The last argument to any function is a callback. Some commands are
special and take other optional arguments.

Configs cannot currently be set on a per function basis, as each call to
npm.config.set will change the value for *all* npm commands in that process.

To find API documentation for a specific command, try the man pages first.
For example, if you wanted documentation on how the "update" command works, try
`man 3 npm-commands-load`.

If all else fails, read the source.

## CONTRIBUTIONS

Patches welcome!

* code:
  Read through `npm help coding-style` if you plan to submit code.
  You don't have to agree with it, but you do have to follow it.
* docs:
  If you find an error in the documentation, edit the appropriate markdown
  file in the "doc" folder.  (Don't worry about generating the man page.)

Contributors are listed in npm's `package.json` file.  You can view them
easily by doing `npm view npm contributors`.

If you would like to contribute, but don't know what to work on, check
