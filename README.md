# We've moved!

Hi! This repository is no longer being used and has been archived for historical purposes.

* CLI source code and pull requests now live at [github.com/npm/cli](https://github.com/npm/cli) instead of here!

* Requests for help, diagnostics and other support questions go in the [support category on npm.community](https://npm.community/c/support).

* Reports of bugs go in the [bugs category](https://npm.community/c/bugs).

* Informal feature requests and ideas get discussed in the [ideas category](https://npm.community/c/ideas).

* More complete and fully-formed feature requests should go through the [formal npm RFC process](https://github.com/npm/rfcs).

* For other concerns, such as package disputes or abuse reports, [email support@npmjs.com](mailto:support@npmjs.com).

For more information on the move, see [our blog post about this transition](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/175587538995/announcing-npmcommunity), and [this thread with additional questions](https://npm.community/t/request-for-more-details-about-moving-from-github-issues-to-npm-community/309). We look forward to seeing you in our new spaces!
