Test noproxy configuration.


We create a server and a proxy.
Server listens on localhost:80.
Proxy listens on localhost:8080.
The proxy redirects all requests to /proxy on the server.
On the server, /proxy sends back proxy.tar.gz .
When server is directly requested, it answers with noproxy.tar.gz .


So we perform 2 tests, both with proxy equal to "http://localhost:8080".
-A test is performed with noproxy equal to "null". In this case, npm
  installs the package named "proxy.tar.gz" because the proxy is used.
-In the other test, noproxy equal "localhost, example.com".
  Since localhost is part of noproxy, request is made directly 
  to the server and proxy is ignored.
